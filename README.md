## Description

AttentionRX is an innovative software solution designed to enhance the analysis and interpretation of medical patient records by cross-referencing them with scholarly journal articles. By leveraging the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, AttentionX identifies symptoms from patient records and provides evidence-based prescription suggestions. The core technology stack includes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and agents powered by LLamaindex, Nomic embeddings, and ChromaDB, facilitating a robust and insightful analysis.

## Key Features

- **Symptom Identification:** Automated identification of symptoms from patient records using advanced natural language processing techniques.
- **Scholarly Journal Integration:** Cross-referencing symptoms with the latest scholarly articles and research for evidence-based diagnosis and prescription.
- **Evidence-Based Prescriptions:** Utilizes cutting-edge AI to suggest prescriptions based on the most current research and data.
- **Advanced Tech Stack:** Incorporates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), LLamaindex, Nomic embeddings, and ChromaDB for comprehensive data analysis and retrieval.

## Tech Stack

- Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- LLamaindex
- Nomic Embeddings
- ChromaDB

## Folder Structure

- `data/`: Contains the dataset of medical patient records and scholarly journal articles.
- `cli_script.py`: Command-line interface script to run the program.
- `AttentionX.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing samples and demonstrations of the project.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AttentionX.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd AttentionX
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
AttentionX can be used through a Command Line Interface (CLI), Jupyter notebooks for interactive sessions, or directly integrated into your projects.

- **Data Folder:** Contains sample patient records and scholarly articles for testing and development purposes.
- **CLI Script:** For processing records through the terminal, navigate to the project directory and run:

- **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive examples and tutorials, open the provided Jupyter notebook:

To run the program, use the following command:
```
python cli_script.py
```

To run preliminary document processing, use the following command:
```
python document_processor.py --doc_dir ./sample --vector_store_path ./chroma_db --collection_name your_collection_name --n_batches 1 --llm_model mistral 
```

For samples and demonstrations, open the `AttentionX.ipynb` Jupyter notebook.
