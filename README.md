## Description

AttentionRX is an innovative software solution designed to enhance the analysis and interpretation of medical patient records by cross-referencing them with scholarly journal articles. By leveraging the latest advancements in artificial intelligence, AttentionX identifies symptoms from patient records and provides evidence-based prescription suggestions. The core technology stack includes Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), and Reflection type agents powered by Langchain, 
Llama3-OpenBioLLM-70B, Qdrant, DSPy and Langsmith, facilitating a robust and insightful analysis.

## Key Features

- **Symptom Identification:** Automated identification of symptoms and getting information about microbe based diseases from patient records using advanced LLMs.
- **Scholarly Journal Integration:** Cross-referencing symptoms with the latest scholarly articles and research for evidence-based diagnosis and prescription.
- **Evidence-Based Prescriptions:** Utilizes cutting-edge AI to suggest prescriptions based on the most current research and data.
- **Advanced Tech Stack:** Incorporates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Langchain, Llama3-OpenBioLLM-70B, Qdrant, DSPy and Langsmith for comprehensive data analysis and retrieval as well as for optimization and evaluation.
