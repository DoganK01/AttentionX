Assessment and Plan:
Based on the patient's presenting symptoms and physical examination, the differential diagnoses include:
1. Venous Stasis Dermatitis
2. Peripheral Artery Disease
3. Contact Dermatitis
4. Cellulitis

The following plan is recommended:
1. Order a duplex ultrasound of the affected leg to assess for venous insufficiency and rule out deep vein thrombosis.
2. Prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream (e.g., Triamcinolone 0.1%) to be applied twice daily to the affected areas to reduce inflammation and itching.
3. Recommend compression stockings to improve venous circulation and reduce swelling.
4. Advise the patient to keep the affected leg elevated when resting and to avoid prolonged standing or sitting.
5. Schedule a follow-up appointment in 2 weeks to reassess the patient's condition and adjust the treatment plan accordingly.

If the symptoms worsen or fail to improve with the current treatment, consider referring the patient to a dermatologist or vascular specialist for further evaluation and management.
