        "abstract": "Bioremediation, the degradation of environmental pollutants by living organisms, has immense potential to lead to a greener planet. Bioinformatics analysis can contribute to the identification of novel microorganisms, which biodegrade contaminants, or of participating proteins and enzymes, and the elucidation of the complex metabolic pathways involved. In this study, we focus on C-P lyase and glyphosate oxidoreductase (Gox), two enzymes which degrade glyphosate, a widely used pesticide. Amino acid sequences of the two enzymes were collected from a broad range of microorganisms using the KEGG database and BLAST. Based on this, we identified additional lineages, with putative glyphosate-degrading activity, for which no glyphosate-degrading species have been reported yet. The conserved residues in each enzyme were identified via multiple alignments and mapped onto the 3D structures of the enzymes, using PyMOL, leading to novel insights into their function. As the experimental structure of Gox is still unknown, we created structural models based on three different programs and compared the results. This approach can be used to yield insights into the characteristics of potential glyphosate-degrading enzymes. Given the limited information available, such a step is important to gain further knowledge about them, which can contribute to their application in bioremediation in the future.",

        "content": "1. IntroductionGlyphosate,N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, is an active ingredient in many widely used, broad-spectrum herbicides (e.g., RoundupTM). It is a synthetic amino acid analogue of glycine incorporating a phosphonic acid [1]. It inhibits enolpyruvylshikimate-3-phosphate synthase (EPSP synthase), resulting in the inhibition of the shikimate pathway, which is essential for the biosynthesis of aromatic amino acids in plants [2].Glyphosate has been characterized as a safe compound by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) for human health, animals, and the environment, as \u201cno critical areas of concern\u201d were confirmed. Additionally, the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) does not classify glyphosate as carcinogenic or possibly carcinogenic [3]. On the other hand, it is considered as \u201cprobably carcinogenic\u201d to humans (Group 2A) according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) [1] and it is labeled as \u201ctoxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects\u201d as per the Hazard Statements of the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (GHS) [1]. Glyphosate was an approved pesticide until December 2023 in the E.U. [3], where its use was recently extended for 10 more years [4].Nevertheless, there is increasing concern about the accumulation of pesticide residues and their metabolites in soils and food crops. In soil sampled from agricultural sites throughout the E.U. and other cooperating countries, glyphosate and its metabolite alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) were among the most frequently detected substances and also among those with the highest concentrations [5]. A case study in central Germany yielded similar results, as glyphosate and AMPA were detected at the highest concentrations in surface water and topsoil samples [6]. Concerns have also been raised about the persistence of glyphosate and its metabolite AMPA in soil, especially in fields where glyphosate-based herbicides have been extensively used [3,7], its potential to bioaccumulate in terrestrial organisms [8], and its impact on crop health [3], while it has also led to glyphosate-resistant weeds [9]. Both compounds are transported off site with rainfall, contaminating surface water, hedgerows, and adjacent non-treated fields [7,8].In particular, glyphosate can affect the microbial population, and hence, have an impact on plant-beneficial microbes [10] and cause metabolic changes in plants, even at low doses [11]. Glyphosate and its salt form, isopropylamine (IPA), also act as chelating agents by binding to metal cations necessary for plant nutrition [12]. Additionally, studies have shown potential negative effects on insects; i.e., rendering insects more prone to infections, inhibiting the production of melanin, disturbing their gut microbiome [13,14,15,16], and leading to a low responsiveness to sucrose [17] and impaired aversive learning [18]. Aquatic organisms are also affected: in zebrafish and other commercial fish, such as Nile tilapia, glyphosate has been linked to developmental problems [19], cardiovascular toxicity [20], oxidative stress and anxiety [21], and kidney disfunction [22]. Glyphosate impacts aquatic ecosystems via changes in the abundance and composition of freshwater picoplanktonic populations [23] and certain species of marine phytoplankton [24]. Glyphosate can have a negative impact on mammals by altering gene expression and affecting DNA methylation in human cells [25,26,27]. The glyphosate-based herbicide RoundupTM, glyphosate, and AMPA can indirectly cause DNA damage by inducing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells [28]. In addition, exposure of human lymphocytes to glyphosate in higher concentrations (200 \u03bcmol/L) than those normally found in the environment (20\u201340 \u03bcmol/L) demonstrated genotoxic effects [29]. It has also been associated with increased urinary glyphosate and AMPA levels in humans [30], which, in turn, have been associated with longer telomere length in leukocytes [31]. Low chronic maternal exposure to glyphosate has also been associated with reduced immune response in mice [32].The degradation of glyphosate can be either biotic, by microorganisms in both aerobic and anaerobic conditions, or abiotic, by Mn-containing minerals [33], and depends on many factors, e.g., whether it is found in water or soil, soil properties, weather conditions, and cultivated plants in the area. Regarding its degradation rate, half-life estimates range from 5 to 180 days [34].There is limited current knowledge about the pathways involved in phosphonate degradation, including glyphosate, their regulation, and the relevant enzymes [35]. Three enzymes have been reported to degrade glyphosate: C-P lyase, which cleaves the bond after phosphorus; and glyphosate oxidoreductase (Gox) and glycine oxidase (GO), which both cleave the C-N bond. The last two enzymes produce the same products but their function is based on a different mechanism (Figure 1).C-P lyase is a protein complex that consists of two copies each of four proteins (PhnG, PhnH, PhnI, PhnJ) and one ATP-binding subunit, PhnK. The degradation of glyphosate by C-P lyase, which takes place under inorganic phosphate (Pi) deficiency [35], results in the production of sarcosine and phosphate. The C-P lyase complex is part of the C-P lyase pathway, which converts phosphonate into PRPP (5-phosphoribosyl-a-1-diphosphate) using ATP [35]. According to the literature, it is widely present across bacteria, and shows broad substrate specificity, as it cleaves the C-P bond of organophosphonates [36]. At first, the tertiary structure of the complex was determined without PhnK (PDB accession number: 4XB6) [37]. A few years later, PhnK was also included in the complex via single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy, which provided valuable insights into the interactions of PhnK with the core complex and the conformational changes before and after utilizing ATP (PDB accession number: 7Z19, with ATP: 7Z18), and also, with PhnL in various conformations (PhnK/PhnL dual ABC dimer, PDB accession numbers: 7Z15, 7Z16) [38]. PhnJ is the active site of the enzyme (Figure S1). It contains an Fe4S4complex and a Zn molecule, which is stabilized by three conserved Cys residues (Cys241, Cys244, and Cys266), found within the conserved motif CX2CX21C. Two more residues are important for the reaction mechanism of the complex: Gly32 and Cys272 [39]. Due to the presence of the fourth conserved Cys residue, it can be included as part of the aforementioned motif, namely, as CX2CX21CX5C [39]. Cys272 is responsible for the generation of a thiyl radical, which cleaves the C-P bond of 5-phosphoribosyl-1-phosphonate. Notably, PhnJ does not contain the signature radical SAM enzyme motif (CX3CX2C), which stabilizes the Fe4S4complex [39]. A second potential active site is located between PhnJ and PhnI, which includes the residues His328 and His333 (PhnI) and His108 (PhnJ). Four further domains (Figure S1) have been described [37]:CMD: C-terminal mini domain (PhnJ);CID: Central insertion domain (PhnJ), which could participate in the binding of PhnK to PhnJ;BBD: Beta barrel domain (PhnI);NTD: N-terminal domain (PhnI).It has been proposed that not all C-P lyases are specific to glyphosate, and that C-P lyase ofEschericha coliis an example of an (amino)alkylphosphate-specific enzyme without glyphosate-degrading activity [35,40]. For this reason, there is the hypothesis that two different types of independently induced C-P lyases exist [35]. However, later research onOchrobactrum anthropiandAchromobactersp. [41] could not provide evidence for the hypothesis of two distinct C-P lyases (Sviridov A, personal communication).The glyphosate oxidoreductase (Gox) gene was first characterized fromAchromobactersp. LBAA, a bacterial strain isolated in a glyphosate waste treatment facility, as part of a Monsanto patent [42], in order to construct glyphosate-resistant plants. Gox is a monomeric FAD-dependent enzyme, cleaving the C-N bond of glyphosate and yielding glyoxylate and the metabolite AMPA. It is speculated that the reduction of FAD takes place in the active site of the enzyme by glyphosate [42]. There is no known experimental structure of Gox, although a computed structural model is available [43].Glycine oxidase (GO) is the third enzyme known to degrade glyphosate. Several GO structures are available in the PDB (e.g., 3IF9, 1NG4 and 1RYI fromBacillus subtilis). It is a homotetrameric enzyme and its substrates include glycine, neutral D-amino acids, and sarcosine. Similar to Gox, it is an FAD-dependent enzyme and it cleaves the C-N bond, yielding the same degradation products: AMPA and glyoxylate. However, Gox and GO show low sequence identity [2] and, based on oxygen utilization, appear to have a different reaction mechanism: oxygen reduction in Gox does not result in the production of hydrogen peroxide, which is the case for GO [2,42]. Several studies have focused on engineering GO in order to enhance its glyphosate-degrading activity [2,44,45,46,47].Given the negative consequences of glyphosate, in this study we look at the characteristics of the proteins of the glyphosate-degrading enzymes at a sequence level as a way to understand and optimize their function, by utilizing bioinformatics tools. As GO has been extensively studied and improved through mutagenesis, we focus on C-P lyase and Gox. Further insights into the enzymatic degradation of glyphosate by bacteria can contribute to the eventual application of bioremediation techniques for a faster removal of glyphosate from affected areas.2. Materials and MethodsInformation on the bacterial species reported to degrade glyphosate and the pathways or enzymes involved in this activity was collected from relevant references in PubMed [48] and ScienceDirect [49] (Table 1). These databases, along with PDB [50], were also used to find the already-available information on enzymes responsible for glyphosate degradation, namely, Gox, C-P lyase, and GO.For C-P lyase, the amino acid sequences for each subunit of the complex were collected using the KEGG Orthology (KO) database [51] and the following entries: PhnJ: K06163, PhnI: K06164, PhnH: K06165, PhnG: K06166, and PhnK: K05781. The available sequences were parsed in such a way that a wide variety of representatives from across the bacterial kingdom were included; the selection was performed manually, using the taxonomy option of the KO entry and selecting at least one representative per family. The selected amino acid sequences are available in the Supplementary Dataset in folder \u201cC-P lyase\u201d. The sequence selected from each taxonomical group was random and we also included the sequence ofE. coli. MUSCLE [52] was used for the multiple alignments, and the highly conserved residues were marked onto the 3D structure using PyMOL (linux version 2.5.2) [53]. The absolutely conserved residues were selected based on Jalview [54] (scoring 11); residues in positions with a Jalview score of 10 were also selected, which reflects that, despite variation, physicochemical properties are conserved [54]. The ScanProsite tool (https://prosite.expasy.org/scanprosite/, accessed on 15 March 2022) was used to search for motifs in the PhnJ sequences of the C-P lyase complex.As there is no KEGG Orthology (KO) group for Gox, BLASTp [55] searches for orthologs in other species were performed using as a query the Gox amino acid sequence ofOchrobactrumsp. G-1 (ACZ58378.1). Two different databases were used:The nr database (BLASTp_nr), which includes all non-redundant GenBank CDS translations and also entries from PDB, SwissProt, PIR, and PRF, excluding environmental samples from WGS projects.RefSeq (BLASTp_ref), which contains only curated entries, i.e., one representative or \u201cSelect\u201d transcript for every protein-coding gene, based on specific criteria [55].Two different BLASTp searches were performed, with default settings, for each database (Table S1), one without any filters (BLASTp_nr_NOGROUP, BLASTp_ref_NOGROUP) and one for each bacterial group (BLASTp_nr_GROUP, BLASTp_ref_GROUP), as defined by Jun et al. [56], aiming at better sampling of more bacterial representatives. The selection of the resulting sequences for BLASTp_nr_NOGROUP and BLASTp_ref_NOGROUP was based on the first 100 sequences with the lowest E-value for each protein query. For the BLASTp_nr_NOGROUP, the highest E-value was 3 \u00d7 10\u2212128and for the BLASTp_ref_NOGROUP 1 \u00d7 10\u2212127(available in Supplementary Dataset). For BLASTp_nr_GROUP and BLASTp_ref_GROUP, the results with the lowest E-value for each protein query from each bacterial group were selected. MUSCLE [52] was used for the multiple alignments.The Gox 3D structure was computed using I-TASSER [57] and Phyre2 [58], which are based on homology modeling, as well as AlphaFold Colab, which performs ab initio prediction [59]. The default settings were used. A general comparison of the results was made by aligning the structures with PyMOL. The results were assessed using QMEANDisCo, which is part of SWISS-MODEL [60].3. Results and Discussion3.1. Distribution of Bacterial Species Previously Reported to Degrade GlyphosateIn the literature, 42 different bacterial species have been reported to degrade glyphosate (Table 1). The majority of the species belong to \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-proteobacteria, a smaller number to bacilli and actinobacteria, and some to bacteroidetes (Figure 2). The enzymes or genes involved in glyphosate degradation have been identified only in some research papers. In most cases, the possible mechanism was inferred based on the products resulting after glyphosate consumption by the bacteria, specifically, based on the presence of sarcosine (indicating C-P lyase activity) or AMPA (indicating Gox activity). In addition to the three known glyphosate-degrading proteins, the presence of a class II EPSPS synthase-encoding gene (aroAgene) has also been reported, although the experimental structure of the protein is not yet known and no further experiments were carried out to test and validate the activity ofaroA[61]. Consequently, the knowledge about the genes and the structure or mechanism of the enzymes involved in glyphosate degradation is still limited.Table 1.Bacterial species reported to degrade glyphosate.

Protein Conservation across ProkaryotesThe entries in KEGG for the proteins of the C-P lyase complex belong to a wide range of bacterial phyla (Figure S2A,C). The bacterial species expected to express C-P lyase based on KEGG (Figure S2) belong to more bacterial groups than the bacterial species reported in the literature as degrading glyphosate (Table 1,Figure 2). This suggests that there are more bacterial species with the potential to degrade glyphosate that have not been studied yet; it may also simply show conserved function against phosphonates, which may or may not include glyphosate. More specifically, the additional bacterial groups found after our KEGG search are actinobacteria, chloroflexi, clostridia, cyanobacteria, \u03b4-proteobacteria, and \u03b5-proteobacteria.For Gox, as there were no relevant KEGG entries, we performed BLASTp and NCBI [90] keyword searches. We were able to find only 13 annotated Gox proteins. Those belong to \u03b1-proteobacteria, \u03b2-proteobacteria, and bacilli, but many of them are partial and the organism is not yet known (Table S2). The BLASTp search results included mostly FAD-dependent oxidoreductases, D-amino acid dehydrogenases, and glycine oxidases. Based on the percent identity of the BLASTp results, the sequences with the general term \u201cFAD-dependent oxidases\u201d showed higher sequence similarity to the annotated Gox sequences than the \u201cD-amino acid dehydrogenases\u201d and GOs; GOs demonstrated the lowest average percent identity (Figure S3).The BLASTp searches for Gox without filtering per group showed fewer bacterial groups than those reported in the literature, namely, sequences only from \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-proteobacteria (Figures S2B, S4 and S5). However, when we performed the searches per bacterial group, the diversity of the results increased significantly (Figure S2B,D). In addition to the aforementioned groups, we found entries belonging to verrucomicrobia, fusobacteria, aquificae, and planctomycetes.Figures S4 and S5show distinctive changes in the phylogenetic distribution of the BLASTp results. Although there are no known motifs of Gox responsible for glyphosate degradation, these BLASTp results are worth investigating further for such a potential.3.3. Conserved Residues in C-P LyaseMultiple alignments of each of the proteins of the C-P lyase complex revealed a large number of conserved residues (Figure S6). The results were compared with the C-P lyase complex ofE. coli(4X6B), which has been extensively studied previously. AlthoughE. colicannot degrade glyphosate, PhnI and PhnJ proteins show a high degree of conservation with glyphosate-degrading bacteria (Sinorhizobium meliloti)[75]. A detailed description of the discovered conserved residues, previous mentions in the bibliography, and the secondary structure of each region are found inTable 2. The position of the highly conserved residues on the tertiary structure of the enzyme is highlighted inFigure S7.From our alignments, many previously unreported conserved residues were discovered, which could be significant for the function of the enzyme. Some of these residues are close to the active site of PhnJ, or are part of the domains CMD, CID (PhnJ), BBD, and NTD (PhnI). The function of certain conserved residues has been suggested previously and, by proximity, we can deduce the function of several of the newly identified conserved residues. For example, residues G208, R209, G47, G49, V125, T50, and G51 were previously found, using molecular docking, to interact with AMPA via hydrogen bonds [43]; we find conservation of these residues, which lends support to their important role, and we suggest that they also surround and may help stabilize the Fe4S4cluster. Also, in addition to the Cys residues surrounding Zn, Gly245 is conserved right next to Cys244, suggesting that this may also contribute to stabilizing Zn. The loop containing the universally conserved Gly32 also contains two more conserved residues (Pro31, Gln34), which could participate in receiving the intermediate radical while catalyzing the substrate formed by SAM. The fact that the CMD domain only contains three conserved residues matches the hypothesis that it might detach from the core of PhnJ during interaction [37]. Conserved His residues in the interface of PhnJ and PhnI also coordinate a second Zn molecule. From our alignments, more residues were found to be conserved in this region in both the PhnJ and PnhI proteins, suggesting that they contribute to the overall structure around Zn. The large number of highly conserved residues supports the assumption that this could be a potential second active site of the C-P lyase complex [37]. PhnG is generally not highly conserved. However, there are a small number of conserved residues in the C-terminal part, which is reported to interact with PhnI [47]. Notably, there is a set of conserved residues, remote from the rest of the C-P lyase core complex, which does not seem to interact with any substrate or other proteins of the complex.Most residues which are reported to be conserved in the literature and play a significant role in the function of the enzyme were also conserved in our alignments. However, five residues of PhnJ that are expected to interact with glyphosate and AMPA in silico [43], and three of the residues participating in the conserved Cys motif of PhnJ, are not absolutely conserved in our alignment. This discrepancy may be because we used more sequences in the alignments compared to Seweryn et al. [37]. Cys244 and Cys266 are present in 96% of the sequences, but they are replaced by amino acids with the same properties (Ser or Thr and Ile or Thr, respectively). The most important change is noticed for Cys272, which plays a significant role in the function of the enzyme as it is the last Cys residue of the conserved motif CX2CX21CX5C [37]. According to our results, position 310 of the multiple alignment, which corresponds to Cys272 ofE. coli, was not absolutely conserved in all sequences and it was replaced by either Met or Leu. The sequences that did not correspond to Cys in this position were:cyb\u2014Synechococcussp. JA-2-3B\u2019a(2-13) (bacteroidota)\u2014Met269;muh\u2014Mucilaginibacter celerHYN0043 (bacteroidota)\u2014Leu276;shv\u2014Salinicoccus haloduransH3B36 (bacilli)\u2014Met269;crn\u2014Carnobacteriumsp. 17-4 (bacilli)\u2014Met27.This raised the question of whether the motif is present in another part of the sequences, and whether the rest of the sequences actually have the conserved motif. Although Cys was conserved in this position for the rest of the entries, in some cases the number of residues between the conserved Cys was different than that determined for the CX2CX21CX5C motif. For this reason, we searched for the motif CX2CX21CX5C in all of our sequences: it was found in only 77 out of 93 PhnJ sequences in total. The 16 sequences in which the motif was not present are shown inTable S3. However, as the typical motif for SAM enzymes is CX3CX2C, and variations of this motif (CX4CX2C, CX5CX2C, CX3CX3C, CX14CX2C) can also be observed [91], we also searched for these motifs in our sequences. The CX3CX2C SAM typical motif was not found in any of the sequences, and none of the sequences without the CX2CX21CX5C motif contain any alternative motif. Only two sequences contained the alternative motif CX5CX2C and, interestingly, both have the motif of PhnJ too: hbe\u2014Halomonas beimenensisNTU-111 (\u03b3-proteobacteria), and stea\u2014Sporolactobacillus terraeDRG1 (bacilli).3.4. Structure of GoxThere is no available experimental structure for Gox in PDB. The only attempt at a structural approach used Phyre2, based on the amino acid sequence ofOchrobactrumsp. G1 (ACZ58378.1) [43]. We created structural models based on AlphaFold Colab and I-TASSER, which present similarities with Phyre2 (Figure 3). According to the evaluation based on QMEANDisCo (Figure S8), the best model is produced by AlphaFold, a conclusion that is supported by the recent assessment of structure prediction models (CASP14), referring to the performance of AlphaFold [92]. Phyre2 and AlphaFold show significant differences in specific regions of the predicted structure, which end up around the surface of the structure (Figure 3andFigure S9). Based on the docking results of Bhatt et al. [43], glyphosate is expected to bind to the center of the protein. There are slight differences between the three models; for example, R358 is part of a loop in I-TASSER but on a beta sheet in AlphaFold and Phyre2, and M388 is in a helix in Phyre2, but part of a loop in I-TASSER and AlphaFold. As glyphosate is a small molecule and these accumulative small changes may alter the shape of the binding site, this can have an impact on the functionality of the proposed binding site on each calculated structure. It is also not known yet if Gox acts as a monomer or dimer/polymer; in the latter case, the peripheral structure may also play a role in subunit interactions.The residues hypothesized by Bhatt et al. [43] to interact with glyphosate were not consistently conserved in our multiple alignments (Table 3). None of the residues were conserved for all datasets, and only N47 and R358 were highly conserved for the results of both BLASTp_nr_NOGROUP and BLASTp_ref_NOGROUP. Residues like V16, A43, and M388 were conserved in less than 50% of the sequences in all 4 alignments. Therefore, further structural and docking studies are needed in order to obtain a more precise model of the Gox active site.4. ConclusionsIn this study, based on BLAST and KEGG searches, additional lineages were identified, which are worth investigation for glyphosate-degrading activity, as no glyphosate-degrading species have been reported from these lineages yet. Furthermore, additional conserved residues have been identified for each protein of the C-P lyase complex. Further studies would be useful to determine their role in the structure and function of the complex. Interestingly, Cys272 of PhnJ fromE. coli, an important residue for the function of the active site of C-P lyase, is overall conserved but not present in all PhnJ sequences, raising the question of whether those PhnJ sequences have an alternative mechanism or if they have a different activity. Given the limited information on glyphosate degradation through the C-P lyase pathway [35], further studies of the C-P lyase pathway and the participating genes are needed, e.g., regarding the efficiency of the enzyme and the dependence of thephngene expression on Pi deficiency.Oxidoreductases are a large group of versatile enzymes [93] with conserved domains of low sequence similarity. There is a big research gap in the amino acid sequences of proteins known to degrade glyphosate, as most studies of glyphosate-degrading activity are based on detecting the degradation products with no further analysis at sequence level or identification of the responsible protein (Table 1). Bioinformatics analysis of already available biological data can contribute to the knowledge about Gox proteins. There are only a few annotated Gox proteins and we lack information about their reaction mechanism, the participating residues, and even the biological function in the bacteria which express them. The BLAST results show that Gox sequences are more similar to \u201cFAD-dependent oxidases\u201d. An experimentally determined Gox structure is not yet available and the binding site of glyphosate to the protein is not known yet. Here, we compare models based on three programs. The majority of the residues previously proposed to interact with glyphosate are not highly conserved in our alignments. Therefore, it would be interesting to create a more detailed structure in silico, which can be used for docking, in order to study the interacting residues and to search for enzymes with similar active sites. This could lead to the discovery of enzymes with higher efficiency, being better candidates to be applied in situ for the remediation of contaminated sites.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at:https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/bacteria3040021/s1, Figure S1: Tertiary structure of the C-P lyase core complex; Figure S2: Distribution of C-P lyase and Gox across the major bacterial lineages; Figure S3: Average percent identity values between the resulting amino acid sequences from our BLASTp searches and the annotated Gox proteins; Figure S4: Phylogenetic distribution of the BLASTp results against the nr database using the Gox ACZ58378.1 as a query sequence; Figure S5: Phylogenetic distribution of the BLASTp results against the Refseq database using the Gox ACZ58378.1 as a query sequence; Figure S6: Conserved residues in C-P lyase deduced from the MUSCLE alignments in this study, shown per protein subunit; Figure S7: Conserved residues in C-P lyase marked on the 3D structure of the enzyme; Figure S8: Scoring of the computed Gox structures; Figure S9: Phyre2 and AlphaFold show significant differences in specific regions of the predicted structure; Table S1: Methodology of the choice of the amino acid sequences for Gox homologs; Table S2: The annotated Gox protein types in NCBI.

        "title": "The Emergence of the Slc11 Clade MCbgut: A Parsimonious Hypothesis for the Dawn of Lactobacillales in the Gut of Early Vertebrates",
        "abstract": "The Lactobacillales (LB) stand apart among bacterial orders, using manganese (Mn) instead of iron to support their growth and swiftly ferment complex foods while acidifying their environment. The present work investigates whether a shift in the use of Mn could mark the origin of LB. Transmembrane carriers of the ubiquitous Slc11 family play key roles in LB physiology by catalyzing proton-dependent Mn import. In prior studies, the Slc11 clade found in LB (MntH Cb, MCb) showed both remarkable structural plasticity and highly efficient Mn uptake, and another Slc11 clade, MCg1, demonstrated divergent evolution coinciding with emergence of bacterial genera (e.g., Bordetella, Achromobacter). Herein, the Slc11 clade MCb is subdivided in sister groups: MCbie and MCbgut. MCbie derives directly from the Slc11 clade MCa, pointing an intermediate stage in the evolution of MCbgut. MCbie predominates in marine Bacillaceae, is more conserved than MCbgut, lacks the structural plasticity that typify MCbgut carriers, and responds differently to identical mutagenesis. Exchanging MCbie/MCbgut amino acid residues at sites that distinguish these clades showed conformation-dependent effects with both MCbie and MCbgut templates, and the 3D location of the targeted sites in the carrier structure together suggests that the mechanism to open the inner gate, and release Mn into the cytoplasm, differs between MCbie and MCbgut. Building on the established phylogeny for Enterococcus revealed that a pair of genes encoding MCbgut was present in the common ancestor of LB, as MCbgu1 and MCbgu2 templates exhibited distinct structural dynamics properties. These data are discussed when examining whether MCbgut+ LB could emerge in the upper gut of early vertebrates (ca. 540 mya), through genome contraction and evolution toward Mn-centrism, as they specialized as gastric aids favoring stomach establishment in jawed vertebrates through bi-directional communication with host nervous, endocrine and immune systems.",

        "content": "1. IntroductionThe Solute carrier 11 (Slc11) family of proton (H+)-dependent importers of Mn2+and/or Fe2+belongs to the APC superfamily and adopts the tridimensional (3D) LeuT fold [1,2,3]. This fold consists of tandem repeats of five transmembrane helices that display inverted transmembrane topology. The repeats fold intertwined and coexist in alternate 3D configurations that are exchanged as the carrier molecule switches between two main states, either outward open (OO) or inward open (IO). The absence of sequence similarity between the two halves of the Slc11 carrier hydrophobic core implies asymmetric evolution, which could favor directional substrate transport, i.e., H+-dependent import [4,5].Molecular evolutionary genetic and structural analyses revealed that Slc11 synapomorphy functionally distinguishes this protein family from the rest of the APC superfamily [6]. Slc11 synapomorphy comprises 11 (quasi) invariant amino acid (aa) residues forming a 3D network that articulates Slc11 substrate-selective carrier conformational exchange between the OO state and the IO state. The functional maintenance of this 3D network amid diverging Slc11 clades (e.g., bacterial MCb and MCg1) testifies to the resilience and evolvability of the molecular mechanism embedded through this synapomorphy in Slc11 architecture.Moreover, the Slc11 mechanism of carrier coupling to the transmembrane protonmotive force (pmf), to catalyze cytoplasmic import of divalent metals such Mn and Fe (Me2+), demonstrated stepwise evolution in the form of serial synapomorphies that distinguished groups of Slc11 homologs found either in prokaryotes (the proton-dependent Mn transporters, MntH) or in eukaryotes (the Natural resistance-associated macrophage proteins, Nramp,Table S1).MntH synapomorphies demonstrate successive sets of coevolutionary rate-shifts that progressively edified an extended \u2018H+-network\u2019 interacting with the pmf, from anaerobic bacteria (MntH B, before aerobiosis) to aerobic bacteria (MntH A) and to hyperthermophile TACK and Asgard Archaea (MntH H). This latter evolutionary intermediate likely shared a common ancestor with the first eukaryotic representative of the Slc11 family (Nramp precursor, [7]).The Slc11 H+-network further evolved in eukaryotes, during the transition from the first to last eukaryotic common ancestor (FECA to LECA), yielding two types of Nramp: prototype Nramp, mainly found in primitive eukaryotes, and archetype Nramp, predominant in multicellular organisms of both animal and vegetal realms (Figure 1A). Coupled with phagocytosis, archetype Nramp can restrict bacterial survival by depleting the acidified phagosomal milieu of Me2+, such as Mn and Fe [8]. Arguably, the evolution of the Slc11 mechanism of carrier coupling to the pmf resulted in functional antagonism, yielding eukaryotic Nramp carriers that import Me2+more efficiently than their bacterial counterparts (MntH).However, both types of prototypeNrampgenes (pN-IandpN-II,Table S1) were independently transferred horizontally towards bacteria. Therefore, bacterial MntH are polyphyletic [9], either of prokaryotic origin (MntH B, MntH A, MntH H) or of eukaryotic ancestry (MntH C). Alphafold (AF) [10]/Colabfold (CF) [11] 3D modeling of native MntH carriers of eukaryotic origin, from the sister clades MntH Cb (MCb) and MntH Cg1 (MCg1)Figure 1), coupled with the modeling of phylogeny-informed site-directed mutants, demonstrated paths of divergent evolution which affected both the carrier shape and functional plasticity [6].A hallmark of MCb carriers is their conformational flexibility, and protein sequences from distinct clades (>80% sequence identity) yield 3D models representing discrete conformers. Regarding MCg, a mutation altering both the H+-network in transmembrane helix 4 (h4) and carrier shape contributed to found MCg1 clade, and further divergent epistasis within this clade yielded an apparently functional neovariant, whose emergence coincided with novel bacterial genera (BordetellaandAchromobacter). This unexpected result suggested that, by analogy, the emergence of the MCb carrier might correspond as well with the rise of other bacterial genera.Indeed, MCb is the only Slc11 type found in the order Lactobacillales (LB), and the majority of known MCbs are encoded by LB genomes. In contrast, the close relatives Bacillales may harbor eithermntH A,mntH CaormntH Cbgenes [7]. The extraordinary flexibility and functional plasticity of MntH Cb 3D models may relate to high carrier efficiency, able to support LB\u2019smntH-dependent competitive exclusion of other organisms [12,13].It is perhaps no coincidence that LB stand out as a bacterial order that relinquished heme-based metabolism to become Mn-centric microorganisms. As Mn excess can jeopardize iron-based metabolic functions, high efficiency Mn import seems particularly suited to cells notably lacking iron-cofactored enzymes for respiration, antioxidant defenses and the tricarboxylic acid cycle [14,15] and which rely on Mn instead of Fe for growth [12,16,17]. Based on the available data, it can therefore be hypothesized that the emergence of the MCb clade is concomitant to the dawn of LB.The consensus on LB origin indicates they derived from a Bacillale ancestor through ~1/3 genome reduction and by adapting to some microaerated/anaerobic nutrient-rich environmental niche [14,15]. Given that LB are both notoriously proficient at predigesting (fermenting) complex food and common residents of animal gut [18,19], it seems plausible that LB could originate there. LB are demonstrated residents of the gut of various vertebrates (fish, reptiles, birds, and mammals) and a landmark study proposing the genusEnteroccoccusarose more than 425 million years ago (mya), as animals colonized land [20], suggests the LB common ancestor could have evolved earlier, during the Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian transition for instance.To test the hypothesis that the emergence of the (Slc11) MCb clade may coincide with LB origin, a sequence of possible evolutionary events linking MCa and MCb clades was established and their functional implications tested in silico using AF/CF 3D modeling. Several questions were addressed: Is there a group of MntH Cb seqs that display common properties identifying them as possible intermediates (hereby named MCbiefor MCb environmental intermediate) between MntH Ca and the rest of the MCb clade (hereafter named MCbgut)? Do MCbie+microorganisms form a defined Bacillale taxon and/or share a common habitat? How do MCbieand MCbgutin silico structural dynamics compare? Do they support a distinct mechanism of Mn import in LB? Does MCbgutemergence predate the origin of Enterococci and what was themntHCbgutgene complement of the common ancestor of LB?The results presented define the Slc11 clades MCbieand MCbgutwhich together form the phylogroup MCb. MCbiepredominates in marine Bacillaceae and is closely related to both its ancestor clade, MCa, and the common precursor of MCbgut. Regarding MCbgut, it is in fact a pair of genes, encoding MCbgu1and MCbgu2, that typifies LB. The three MCb clades MCbie, MCbgu1and MCbgu2vary in their evolutionary conservation and conformational properties as the opening of the carrier inner gate apparently evolved in the transition from MCbieto MCbgut. These data are discussed, relating the emergence of MCbgut+LB and the development of the gastro-intestinal tract of early vertebrates.2. In Silico Results2.1. P. halotolerans A0A1I3CNB9 Identifies the Clade MCbie, Intermediate between MCa and MCbgutPrior work suggested that reevaluating the phylogenetic structure of the MCb clade may delineate a putative precursor lineage (MCbie) from LB\u2019s MCbs (MCbgut). NCBI sequence wp_092092601.1 from the CarnobacteriaceaePisciglobus halotolerans(Uniprot ID: A0A1I3CNB9), representing a cluster of sequences (seqs > 70% aa id), identified the most basal branching node of MCb and demonstrated relatively little specific divergence compared to the rest of the MCb clade [7]. Detailing the phylogenetic relationships of the A0A1I3CNB9 clade, i.e., MCbie, amid eukaryotic prototype Nramps and other bacterial MntH C clades (Figure 1B) confirmed both its basal position relative to the rest of MCb homologs, i.e., the MCbgutclade, and the relative sequence conservation of its members.MCbieconservation contrasts with the diversity of the MCa clade, which comprises both the closest known relatives of prototype Nramp-I (pN-I) and candidate precursors of both MCb and MCg clades [7]. The phylogenetic position of MCbieidentifies an evolutionary intermediate between MCa and MCbgut(Figure 1andFigure S1). MCbieclade topology shows two subsets (Figure S1A): a \u2018crown\u2019 formed by conserved sequences from core marine Bacillales (Bacillaceae, Paenibacillaceae) plus more divergent subsets from other (Lacto)bacillales spp. that exhibit relatively reduced genomes.MCbieis most prevalent in Bacillaceae (45 seqs, 95% id cutoff,Figure S1A) and MCbie+genera represent about 10% of the Bacillaceae family (Figure S1B). MCbiephylogeny segregates several established genera of Bacillaceae, a pattern seemingly compatible with the vertical inheritance ofmntHCbie. Yet, both Bacillaceae and Planococcaceae encode predominantly the more ancestral MntH A (MA) protein, which contrasts with Paenibacillaceae wherein MntH Ca (MCa) predominates (205 seqs, 95% id cutoff). Neither Listeriaceae [21,22,23] nor Carnobacteriaceae (LB) harbor any MA coding gene, and contrarily to Paenibacillaceae, MCb (MCbieor MCbgut) is enriched in both of these families. In comparison, Lactobacillaceae possess exclusively MCbgut(MCbgu1and/or MCbgu2, detailed inSection 2.6).The topology of the MCbie\u2018crown\u2019 group shows clusters of seqs from Paenibacillaceae that diverge from clusters of seqs from Bacillaceae (Figure S1A). Moreover, only spp. of Paenibacillaceae (e.g.,Paenibacillus: NZ_CP019717, NZ_CP020327 andBrevibacillus: CP048799, CP139435) were found harboring both genes encoding MCa and MCbie, including somePaenibacillusisolates wherein MCbieappears inactivated (NZ_CP019794, NZ_CP020557). Together with the large genome size of MCbie+Paenibacillaceae spp., the data support that MCbiecould originate in Bacillaceae and subsequently spread among Paenibacillaceae spp. Similarly,mntHCbiegene transfers toward spp. showing genome erosion (e.g., Listeraceae and Carnobacteriaceae) may account for the relative divergence of their encoded MCbieproteins.Phylogenomic analyses [24,25] support this interpretation, showing marine MCbie+Bacillaceae, e.g.,HeyndrickxiaandLederbergiagenera, as more likely candidate precursors of LB than the MA+Bacillusspp. (B. subtilisandB. anthracis,Figure 2andFigure S2). Staphylococcaceae and Listeriaceae are known as highly derived Bacillales families of Fe-dependent bacteria [26,27] and both lack MA encoding genes.Altogether, the data presented clarify the emergence of the Slc11 clade MCb from its precursor MCa (itself derived from eukaryotic pN-I,Figure 1A). An intermediate step in this process produced the sister clades MCbieand MCbgut, respectively, predominant in marine Bacillaceae, such asHeyndrickxiaandLederbergia, which are aerobic, and in anaerobic LB. These results provide molecular insight into the hypothetical evolutionary transition relating MA+Bacillales to MCbgut+LB through a marine MCbie+Bacillaceae intermediate.2.2. AF/CF 3D Modeling of Native MCbieand MCbgutCarriers Differs SignificantlyThe multiple alignment of diverse sequences from the three groups MCa, MCbieand MCbgutdemonstrate 29 membranous sites that coevolved in the transition between MCa and MCb, i.e., coevolved mutations fixed in the common ancestor of MCbieand MCbgut(Figure 3A,B). Also, sequence variations in extra membranous loops of the carrier molecule show several instances of selective conservation between MCa and MCbievs. MCbgut(e.g., l 4/5, l6/7, l7/8, l8/9 and l9/10,Figure S3), indicating that the common precursor of the MCb clade evolved directly from MCa.A 3D display of these 29 coevolved sites between MCa and MCb, on superposed MCbgutmodels representing both the OO and IO states (cracked-open representation segregating half segments of helix 5 (h5),Figure 3C), shows accumulation along h5. The tilt of h5 modeled during MCbgutcarrier conformation switch was shown to mobilize separate communities of networked residues, involving one or the other half of h5, each contributing to open the inner gate of the carrier toward the cell interior [6]. The 29 (MCa/MCb) rate-shifted sites segregate in distinct areas involving either h5C, h7C, h1b, h2N, h6a and h11C (right panel) or h5N, h4C and h8N plus additional sites scattered across the \u2018hash module\u2019, which hosts a large part of the Slc11 H+-network (left panel).These data indicate that evolution of the precursor of the MCb clade directly from MCa involved a set of coevolved sites. These evolutionary coupled mutations, common to both MCbieand MCbgut, may form a clade-specific (MCb) synapomorphy. Their accumulation in local areas of the 3D structure that involve one half or the other of h5, whose tilting during MCbgutcarrier cycle connects outer gate locking and inner gate opening [6], suggests these processes evolved in the transition from the MCa to MCb common ancestor.The 3D modeling properties of MCbguttemplates differ from other MntH C clades, apparently due to their intrinsic carrier plasticity and the presence of flexible loops [6,7]. Based on the candidate MCb synapomorphy (Figure 3B,C), one could expect that AF2/CF models of native MCbiecarriers would resemble known MCbgutstructures either modeled or solved. However, the 3D modeling of MCbietemplates differed significantly (Figure 4).The 3D correspondence of available Uniprot/AF2 MCbiemodels showed very similar predicted structures that did not clearly segregate with either the OO state or the IO state of solved structures of MCbguthomologs (Figure 4A). This result contrasts with the array of functional conformers that AF2 predicted using MCbgutsequences (Figure 4A, inset).Examining the models obtained for four representative MCbietemplates (~70% pairwise aa id) shows they do not represent clearly distinct OO or IO candidate conformers (Figure 4B), and their sequence relationships (cfFigure 1B, i.e., between WP_256212980.1 (NCBI proxy for Uniprot A0A143Y4E1), WP_092092601.1 (A0A1I3CNB9), WP_092652552.1 (A0A1H9T065) and WP_277619782.1 (proxy for A0A3D8TQ78)) suggests MCbiephylogeny does not influence AF2 or CFnt predictions. The two sequences that produced similar CFnt models, apparently closer to the MCbgutIO state, were selected for further analysis (A0A143Y4E1 and A0A1H9T065, both from Carnobacteriaceae spp.,Trichococcus palustrisandIsobaculum melis, respectively).The topology of the MCb clade (MCbieand MCbgut) resembles the previously characterized MCg1 clade ([6] andFigure 1B): both subdivide in sister groups that differ in their relative extent of divergence. For the MCg1 clade, this situation was correlated with (i) founding mutations that introduced intrinsic structural constraints and (ii) reversion to a less constrained model structure as a result of extensive epistatic divergence.Regarding MCbgut, divergence from the MCb common ancestor produced remarkably flexible and intrinsically dynamic structures, whose predicted conformations reflected phylogenetic diversity (Figure 4A, inset). In contrast, the 3D models obtained using relatively diverse MCbieseem structurally constrained (Figure 4B), suggesting that MCbgutcould evolve out of epistatic divergence from (its common ancestor with) MCbie.2.3. Evolution of MCb Carrier Cycling between MCbieand MCbgutTo examine this, the possible functional evolution between MCbieand MCbgutwas investigated by comparing the AF/CF 3D modeling of native and mutant templates targeted at sites that underwent coevolutionary rate-shifts in the transition from MCbieto MCbgut(putative MCbgutsynapomorphy). Meaning, 15 or 16 mutations that distinguish MCbgutfrom MCbiewere cointroduced into the sequences A0A143Y4E1 and A0A1H9T065, respectively (71.5% aa id,Figure 4C andFigure 5A andTable S2). This approach aimed at testing the impact on the MCbiepredicted structure of 17 comutations that typify instead the MCbgutclade.As a result, the CFnt modeling of the compound mutant A0A143Y4E1_15mt (Table S2) predicted a structure closer to the IO state of MCbgut(Figure 4C). This suggested MCbgutsynapomorphy may signify functional determinants, as the corresponding residues map to 3D areas either partially overlapping with MCb synapomorphy (Figure 5A andFigure 3B,C, respectively) or specific to MCbgut(e.g., l 7/8). In addition, while the native MCbieA0A143Y4E1 CFnt model cannot fully superimpose onto the MCbgutIO CFpdb model (Q5HQ64_WFLF, [6]), the predicted structure for the compound mutant A0A143Y4E1_15mt does so almost perfectly (Figure 5B).These data suggest that a select portion of MCbgutcarrier, which contributes to inner gate opening [6], was rearranged compared to MCbie. Per residue root mean square deviation (pRMSD) from the MCbgutIO CFpdb model (Q5HQ64_WFLF) shows the segments rearranged in the MCbiecompound mutant include l1/2 & h2, h4-h6, l 7/8 & h8, and l 9/10 & h10 (Figure 5C). These structural rearrangements extend beyond the areas targeted for mutagenesis (Figure 5A), implying the targeted sites may directly mediate MCb carrier conformation change.Investigating this further, the reciprocal mutational approach was applied to MCbguthomologs from distinct clades (>80% aa id) that produce discrete native conformers, either OO or IO or in between ([6] andFigure 6A), to determine how MCbie-specifying residues affect the MCbgutpredicted structure.This yielded two types of results: (i) for templates whose predicted native conformers adopt the IO state, the 17 mutations introduced resulted in the prediction of OO conformers, a result similar to that obtained by targeting instead five sites of Slc11 synapomorphy ([6] andFigure 6A,B); (ii) considering templates whose predicted native conformers adopt the OO state or in-between state, identical compound mutagenesis had comparatively little or no effect.The conformational effects of the reciprocal mutageneses performed were both asymmetric and specific, favoring an MCbgut-like IO state for the MCbieA0A143Y4E1_15mt mutant while triggering MCbgutconformation switch from the IO state to the OO state but showing marginal effects on alternate MCbgutcarrier conformational states (OO and in between). Together these results demonstrate the functional impact of exchanging a set of coevolved residues that distinguish MCbgutfrom MCbie, showing a conformation-dependent effect on MCbgutcarrier 3D modeling.2.4. Mutagenesis of Slc11 Synapomorphy Supports Functional Divergence of MCbgutand MCbieA comparative analysis of CF modeling sensitivity to mutagenesis targeting Slc11 synapomorphy has proven useful to decipher the functional evolution between MCb and MCg1 clades and within the MCg1 clade [6]. The introduction of the canonical VNT mutation (h6 VY, h3 YN, and h6 T) into templates from both clades resulted in the conversion of native IO conformers into OO mutant conformers. However, the respective sensitivity to either h3 YN and/or h6 VY+/\u2212h6 T mutations varied between clades.Applying the VNT mutation to MCbieA0A143Y4E1 produced the expected CFnt modeling result, which predicted an OO conformer like the reference MCbgutQ5HQ64-VNT [6], indicated by a comparable broad scale rearrangement (Figure 7A) and quasi-superimposable structures (Figure 7B). In contrast, none of native A0A143Y4E1 predicted structures (using CFnt or AF2) nor the CFnt model for A0A143Y4E1_15mt fitted alike the MCbgutOO model conformer. Hence, mutating five sites of Slc11 synapomorphy induced a conformational response of MCbieA0A143Y4E1 like those observed before with the MCbgutand MCg1 clades.However, detailing the effect of h3 YN and/or h6 VY+/\u2212h6 T mutations showed that, unlike MCbgut, MCbieA0A143Y4E1 predicted conformation was fully switched in response to the h3 YN mutation only (Figure 8A,B), as previously observed using MCg1 A0A149PND7 [6]. Yet, contrary to MCg1 A0A149PND7, additional mutations targeting potential suppressor sites of a YN-induced conformation switch had no impact on the modeling of A0A143Y4E1 YN (Figure 8C).In addition, A0A143Y4E1_15mt modeling was insensitive to h3 YN mutagenesis and neither the A0A143Y4E1 YN, A0A143Y4E1_15mt YN nor A0A143Y4E1_15mt model were affected by adding two other h3 mutations (Figure 8D). Furthermore, reversing three coevolutionary rate-shifts that distinguish MCbgutin l 7/8 (DPA sites #582, #589, #596,Figure 5A) restored a degree of conformational response to h3 YN mutagenesis, observed with the A0A143Y4E1_15mt DPAYN model, akin to the A0A143Y4E1 YN modeling response (Figure 8E).These results indicate MCbiemodeling operated the conformation switch toward the OO state in response to the Slc11 synapomorphy VNT mutation, as expected from prior modeling studies of MCbgutand MCg1. But MCbieA0A143Y4E1 modeling displays unique sensitivity to h3 YN mutation, which is lost after introducing 15 evolutionary coupled mutations that specify the clade MCbgut. These data support divergent structure/function relationships between MCbgutand MCbieand suggest a conformational role for intervening loops that are distal from the Mn2+binding site.2.5. Conformation-Dependent Impact of Mutations Targeting MCb l 7/8 and l 8/9Reversing MCbie/MCbgutrate-shifts in l 7/8 (DPA) was guided by observing that they map to a specific area of the MCbgutstructure (Figure 5A), i.e., not part of the evolutionary transition from MCa to MCb (Figure 3B,C) and polymorphic (Figure S3). And preserving this area as is in MCbieretained some conformational flexibility in the MCbiemutant A0A143Y4E1_15mt DPAYN (Figure 8E). Moreover, the functional importance of these DPA residues for MCbieconformational response to h3 YN mutagenesis is underscored by their conservation in the MCa clade (Figure S3, sites #582, #589, #596).Along similar lines, mutation at site #632 (Figure 5A) in l 8/9 (Figure S3) was reevaluated. To mimic more precisely the MCbie/MCbgutresidue exchange vs. the MCbie/MCa exchange, the two sites #632 and #633 (cfFigure S3) were initially mutated in A0A143Y4E1_15mt (counted as one mutation). To verify whether this dual mutation also introduced a 3D constraint, it was reverted as well, either alone or combined to l 7/8 DPA reversion mutation (Figure 9A). In both instances, restoring MCbienative sequence in l 8/9 recovered some conformational flexibility. The modeling of the amended mutant A0A143Y4E1_15mt DPA-KP responded to YN-induced conformation exchange like native A0A143Y4E1 (Figure 9C). However, in the absence of the YN mutation, the amended mutant A0A143Y4E1_15mt DPA-KP deviated locally from the reference MCbgutQ5HQ64 IO conformer (Figure 9B) and did not appear superimposable anymore (Figure 9C,D).In sum, introducing 15 coevolutionary rate-shifts that distinguish MCbgutfrom MCbieinto MCbierecipient A0A143Y4E1 allows for the modeling of an IO conformer that is superimposable onto the MCbgutreference IO conformer (A0A143Y4E1_15mt). Conversely, the reciprocal mutagenesis of MCbgutmembers demonstrated native conformation-dependent effects, underscoring the functional significance of the targeted sites (cfSection 2.3).However, A0A143Y4E1_15mt lost 3D flexibility and responsiveness to the YN-induced conformation exchange from the IO state to the OO state. This impact was alleviated by reverting five of the mutations that targeted extramembranous loops distal from the substrate binding site (l 7/8 & l 8/9). Yet, these same reverted sites abrogated the 3D resemblance observed between the MCbiecompound mutant and reference MCbgutstructure in the IO state. These five sites therefore demonstrate a conformation-dependent effect in the MCbietemplate A0A143Y4E1, and similar results were obtained using another MCbietemplate, A0A285P4W2 (from the BacillaceaeTerribacillus aidingensis,Figure S4).To conclude, reciprocal mutations of coevolutionary rate-shifts that took place as MCbieand MCbgutdiverged exert distinct conformation-dependent effects on the 3D modeling of members of each clade. This implies the targeted sites contribute to the mechanism of MCb carrier cycling, but their respective role may differ within the MCbieor MCbgutmodel structure. Together, these data relate MCbgut-specific functional divergence to the IO state of the carrier, which seems consistent with a possible shift in Mn import capacity in LB.2.6. MCbgutPhylogeny Reveals a Pair of Distinct Carriers in the Common Ancestor of LBTo approximate a possible period for this functional transition, from marine MCbie+Bacillaceae toward MCbgut+LB, MCbgutphylogeny was further explored, first, among spp. of the Enterococcaceae family because its origin was dated (>425 million years ago [20]) and its structure comprises four clades, one of which diverged basally [30]. MCbgutphylogeny is complex due to pervasive horizontal gene transfers [31] and multiple copies per genome (e.g., six in theLevilactobacillus suantsaiistrain CBA3634 chromosome, NZ_CP059603.1). This may explain why the phylogenies of enterococcacal MCbgutand Enterococci spp. vary (Figure S5). But the general topology of the tree and the profound dichotomy of theEnterococcusclade A vs. clades B-D were recovered, implying a significant phylogenetic signal encoded by MCbgut. The separate grouping of MCbgutseqs resulting from gene transfer to bacteria of different phyla, either enterobacterial or actinobacterial spp., indicates distinct events. The position of the EnterococcaceaeP. termitisseq suggested it may demarcate two types of MCbgut, meaning that perhaps the common ancestor of Enterococcaceae possessed a pair of distinctmntHCbgutgenes.To address this possibility, MCbgutphylogeny was determined across the LB order using a set of representative seqs from each LB family (Figure 10). The results show the presence of two clusters of MCbgut, labeled MCbgu1and MCbgu2, found both in Enterococcaceae and Lactobacillaceae. In addition, the data suggest two other clades could diverge independently from MCbgu2.The present tree thus supports the possible existence of two MCbgutcopies in the common ancestor of LB. Several spp. of Lactobacillaceae harbor both genes encoding MCbgu1and MCbgu2on their chromosome (e.g., NZ_LT854705.1, NZ_CP059603.1), implying perhaps some LB retained both genes since their origin.The presence of both MCbgu1and MCbgu2in the common ancestor of LB suggests they are not functionally equivalent. To evaluate this proposal, three individual sequences from each type were subjected to AF/CF modeling using either native sequences or compound mutants. Native AF2 models showed that, both in Lactobacillaceae and Enterococcaceae, MCbgu1and MCbgu2yielded distinct conformers in the OO state (Figure 11A andFigure 11B, respectively). The MCbgu2type appeared closer to the fully OO conformation and less structurally conserved among Enterococcaceae. The introduction of a set of (reciprocal) mutations corresponding to the MCbie/MCbgutevolutionary transition (cfSection 2.3) confirmed it had little impact on the OO conformers of the MCbgu1and MCbgu2types. These data are in accordance with previous observations showing a strong phylogenetic component in the AF/CF modeling of MCbgut[6].To compare MCbgu1and MCbgu2structural dynamics a combination of mutations able to mimic the carrier forward transition, i.e., exchanging the OO state modeled by CF pdb using the native sequence for the IO state of a mutated carrier, was necessary. Along sites previously identified as conformationally active, either as part of Slc11 synapomorphy or contributing to inner gate opening, additional sites were targeted in helices 3, 4, 8 and 9, which together constitute the Slc11 carrier \u2018hash module\u2019 known to interact with the pmf [2,3]. All targeted sites are evolutionary conserved so that identical mutations were introduced among both the MCbgu1and MCbgu2templates (Table S2).Introducing a series of 15 phylogenetically aware mutations into thePaucilactobacillus wasatchensistemplate PLBgu1enabled us to model an IO conformer like the MCbgutQ5HQ64 reference CF model (Figure 12A,C). Applying this combination of mutations to other MCbgu1had a similar yet less pronounced effect, producing models more advanced toward, albeit not switched to, the IO state (Figure 12E andFigure S6A,C). In comparison, the MCbgu2mutant response appeared more sequence-specific with two templates (Ecegu2, Lbrgu2) progressing toward the IO state (Figure 12F andFigure S6B,D).To further distinguish the modeling properties of MCbgu1and MCbgu2templates, a set of discriminatory type ii evolutionary rate-shifts was targeted to perform reciprocal residue exchanges between MCbgu1and MCbgu2seqs (Figure 12D). Again, all three MCbgu1behaved similarly and were modeled into more OO conformers, implying some antagonism between the two series of mutations tested altogether (Figure 12G andFigure S6E). Reciprocal mutagenesis had distinct effects on MCbgu2templates, which appeared either unchanged or further progressing toward the IO state (Figure 12H andFigure S6F).Lastly, evolutionary conservation among representative sets of MCbgu1and MCbgu2seqs suggests these clades experienced distinct selective pressures (Figure 12I,J andFigure S7).From these results, it is concluded that MCbgutphylogeny replicates the evolutionary dichotomy previously established amongEnteroccoccusspp. It appeared the common ancestor of LB likely possessed a pair of genes encoding seemingly distinct types of MCbgut. The transition from marine Bacillaceae MCbietoward LB\u2019s MCbgutcould proceed sequentially with the functional evolution of a substrate-dependent step, such as inner gate opening, followed by gene copying and a separate evolution of distinct carriers.3. DiscussionThis in silico study correlates the emergence of LB with the functional divergence of a pair of (Slc11) MCbgutcarriers. MCbgutcarriers share a common ancestor with their sister clade MCbie, and together, they form the group MCb, which evolved from the group MCa. MCbiepredominates in marine Bacillaceae and demonstrates evolutionary conservation; it relates directly MCa to MCbgutbecause MCbieseqs display non-overlapping patterns of identical residues with relatives from each group. Comparative studies between the sister clades MCbieand MCbgutindicate functional innovation to open the inner gate of MCbgutcarriers as well as MCbgut-specific structural dynamics plasticity. Apparently, MCbgutcould evolve from MCbiein response to selective pressure that fosters functional divergence. Assuming this was the case, such evolutionary pressure indicated novel environmental conditions. It is hypothesized that the gastro-intestinal tract of early marine vertebrates provided a novel niche conducive for the progressive evolution of an MCbie+Bacillaceae into the ancestor of LB, which carried a pair of genes coding for distinct MCbgut.To what extent did the data gathered support the possibility that Mn-dependent, MCbgut+LB evolved from some Bacillaceae precursor adapted to marine environment? First, several bacterial orders enriched in MCa+spp. (e.g., Cyanobacteria, Pseudomonadales (gamma proteobacteria, GPB), Burkholderiales (BPB), Rhodobacterales, Sphingomonadales, Hyphomicrobiales (Rhizobiales, APB)) [7] might have formed Precambrian subaerial microbial mats that could includeBacillusspp. [32,33]. Such a terrestrial setting would facilitate the acquisition of themntH Cbiegene precursor (mntHCa) by someBacillusspp. Bacillaceae represent the primary source of themntH Cbiegene, consistent with evidence of recent gene transfers toward different spp. of Paenibacillaceae (PaenibacillusandBrevibacillusspp.) in whichmntHCa dominates. And many MCbie+genera are marine Bacillales found in deep-sea sediments (e.g.,Bacillus,Paenibacillus,LysinibacillusandTerribacillusspp.), while others populate various environments, including the gut of animals [34,35].Second, while the MntH A (MA) type, which is ancestral to allmntHC genes that were derived from eukaryotic cells (Figure 1A,Table S1), predominates in Bacillaceae, a fraction of Bacillaceae spp. acquainted with marine environment adopted instead MCbie. MCbiephylogeny indicates genera such asLederbergia,Siminovitchia,Heyndrickxia, andNeobacillus(Figure S1B, [36]) may have inheritedmntHCbievertically. Their phylogeny suggests these species as more likely candidate precursors of LB than MA+Bacillaceae, such asB. subtilisandB. cereus. Also, these marine Bacillaceae grow aerobically, which implies Fe-based metabolism, and some were recovered as well from a dairy environment or found in the gut of various animals. The emergence of MCbiefrom MCa in marine Bacillaceae could thus mark a first step in the adaptation to the gut of animals such as invertebrates.A consolidated hypothesis may thus be viewed in successive steps (Figure 13) with (i) the emergence of MCa+Bacillaceae within subaerial/terrestrial microbial mats, which also colonized marine habitat, (ii) the adaptation of marine MCbie+Bacillaceae to the gut of invertebrates, and (iii) the selection of Mn-dependent LB carrying a pair ofmntHCbgutgenes in the gut of early vertebrates. Previous studies suggest an exchange of MA for MCa affected the coupling of the pmf to Mn2+import [7], which could improve resistance to environmental stresses (e.g., dessication, temperature, osmotic stress) and provide a path toward adaption to an acidic environment through the evolution of MCa to MCbieand then to MCbgut\u2014a step shown to the impact opening of the inner gate to carry Mn2+ions inside cells. Prior works on MCbguthomologs revealed both the plasticity of their functional dynamics [6] and their efficient use by LB to pump Mn2+in competitive environments [12].Whether this LB evolution toward Mn-based metabolism matched the final design of the gastro-intestinal (GI) tract of early vertebrates is a matter of conjecture. But this possibility may provide an interesting angle to approach our intimate relationships with LB because vertebrate development owed to successive innovations following the differentiation of the pharynx at the entry of the digestive tract in chordates, including, for instance, the development of sensory organs and vertebrate novelties such as the spleen, individualized pancreas, heart innervation and the eye\u2019s own muscles [37,38], which might have fostered mutualistic interactions between emerging LB and their host.Vertebrate inventions took place around the 1R whole genome duplication (WGD) that occurred in the early Cambrian and which produced, in particular, the archetype Nramp \u2018Ohnologs\u2019 Nramp1 and Dmt1 ([39,40,41] andFigure S8).NRAMP1(SLC11A1) expression depends on C/EBP [42,43] and dominates in the spleen, blood and tissue phagocytes, contributing to host resistance to infection [8,44]. Dmt1/Nramp2 (Slc11a2) catalyzes H+-dependent Fe2+import both as part of the transferrin endocytic cycle that delivers iron through the body and at the apical membrane of duodenal enterocytes [45,46]. This context may suggest the Ediacaran transition to early Cambrian as a possible evolutionary interval for LB emergence while the GI tractus of early vertebrates was developing into its final form.High efficiency Mn intracellular accumulation under acidic conditions makes physiological sense for LB because Mn as a micronutrient accelerates their growth under lactate stress [47]. The lactic acidification of an LB environment has important effects on the GI tract: inhibiting the growth of potential microbial pathogens while providing a nutrient for potentially beneficial bacteria, such as the spore-forming component of the colonic microbiota [48], which, by consuming lactate that is transformed into short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), may stimulate LB growth in return [49,50]. These effects, added to LB\u2019s ability to predigest complex foods could possibly help develop the GI tract of early vertebrates by favoring the differentiation of the gastric organ (stomach).The GI tracts of urochordates and cephalochordates comprise organs homologous to the liver and pancreas of vertebrates, and chordates share the molecular basis of extracellular digestion with vertebrates. Yet, their genomes lack thepepsinogengene encoding a gastric digestive enzyme and cephalochordates demonstrate evidence of intracellular digestion in the hepatic cecum. This suggests that extracellular digestion systems based on both stomach and pancreatic digestive enzymes emerged specifically in the common ancestor of vertebrates ([51,52] and based on the homologs of GTEx stomach-specific encoded polypeptides, [53], detected in Cephalochordates: Lipase F, gastric type >50% aa id; in Chondrichthyes: Pepsinogen >60% aa id; in Tetrapods: Trefoil factor 1 & 2, >67% aa id).LB strains isolated from mammalian source (mainly rodents) colonize the gastric epithelium by forming biofilms [18,54,55,56]. To resist the harsh environment of the stomach lumen, LB use glutamate and aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylases which help in sustaining the transmembrane pmf to energize metabolism and transport [57,58]. The fact that these bacterial enzymes produce amino acid-derived compounds used as neurotransmitters (NTs) in bilaterian animals [59], such as serotonine, dopamine and GABA [55], both in the central nervous system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system (ENS) [60], suggests a possible feed forward loop [61] where proto-LB residing in the upper gut of some vertebrate ancestor would respond to food intake by generating an acidic environment, facilitating digestion and contributing to gut\u2013brain signaling.An acidic environment in the duodenum of vertebrates is key for absorbing the growth supporting micronutrient iron in the form of Fe2+[46]. As it seems, selection of duodenal Slc11a2- and H+-dependent Fe2+uptake may thus correspond to the period of the establishment of the vertebrate stomach. And the prospect that these processes were supported by Mn2+-dependent acid-resistant LB expressing MCbgutparologs may bear significance in terms of distinct substrate selectivity among Slc11 homologs and the partition of micronutrient resources for mutual benefits [62] to the vertebrate host (Fe) and to the LB residing in its gut (Mn). Arguably, an example of ecological\u2013evolutionary interaction [61,63,64] that provided a rich foundation to diversify vertebrate holobionts.Previous in silico data obtained with MCbgutdemonstrated highly plastic structural dynamics that may increase Mn import efficiency, hereby sustaining LB resistance to acidic and osmotic stress. Herein, a further study of MCbgutrevealed a parology that predated LB radiation, while the sister carrier MCbieshowed structural differences likely altering Mn intracellular release. These data may suggest that the evolution of LB MCbgutcould foster a novel, Mn-dependent way of life in an acidic environment stocked up with food while relinquishing the use of Fe to their host. This process was likely progressive, contracting LB\u2019s ancestral MCbie+Bacillaceae genome and going along with the differentiation of the stomachal pouch as a specialized organ in the neo gastro-intestinal tract of the ancestor of jawed vertebrates.Gastric LB could impact host behavior and food habits through the synthesis of NTs that act directly on leukocytes within the GI tract lamina propria and affect nerve ganglia of the ENS, producing signals relayed through afferent vagal connections to the CNS [65,66]. These instructions could be modulated by intestinal SCFA-producing bacteria, which may act directly on vagal intestinal terminals and stimulate NT signals [67]. In return, efferent vagal influx from the CNS toward the spleen produces NTs that directly regulate the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines by leukocytes [68]. Similarly, enteric bacteria could also modulate local steroid secretion, contributing to reduce stress hormone levels and inform the CNS to adjust behavioral output [60]. It would seem possible that the emergence of LB is owed at least partly to their ability to communicate with their host via the gut\u2013brain axis.Vertebrate transition to extracellular intestinal digestion presented inherent risks that required immunological surveillance because luminal microbes opting for a pathogenic lifestyle may weaken the intestinal barrier\u2019s integrity and create a portal for host infection [69,70]. Viewing regulatory lymphocytes as metabolic sensors, the fact that Tregs mediate suppressive functions when food is scarce, whereas the inflammatory functions of Th17 are fueled by glycolysis [71,72], suggests food digestion potentially incurs intestinal inflammation that depends on subsequent resolution to maintain homeostasis and develop immune tolerance to food-derived determinants [73]. Also, lactic acid sensing has an anti-inflammatory effect by modulating macrophage phenotype polarization [74,75]. According to these views, gut LB and SCFA producers and their metabolites could directly instruct the emerging adaptive immune system while sustaining systemic innate immunity due to Firmicutes intrinsic lysozyme sensitivity [76].Also, both lymphocyte and erythrocyte cell types emerged as vertebrate specificities [77]. Duodenal Fe absorption boosted with gastric acidification likely helped develop the erythron (e.g., hetero-tetrameric hemoglobin in jawed vertebrates, [78]) to distribute oxygen within tissues and sustain their metabolic activity. Apparently, LB Mn-based metabolism and gastric acidification could thus enhance host Fe- and oxygen-based metabolism. And combined with their behavioral and immunological influence, LB\u2019s role in stimulating host metabolism could elevate energetic efficiency and help diversify early vertebrates. The divergence of LB families may have been contemporaneous, perhaps reflecting various mutualist interactions implemented by diverse hosts.According to recent views, the Ediacaran\u2013Cambrian transition, which produced animal radiation, could be due to a combination of causes, including transient catastrophic events (snowball earths and hypoxic environments) and progressive \u2018biotic replacement\u2019 through successive pulses of evolutionary innovations and ecosystem engineering [79,80,81,82,83,84]. The 1R genome duplication that occurred prior to the divergence of jawed vertebrates may indeed testify to disruptive environmental changes during this period. On the other hand, the ability of extant LB probiotics to regulate mammalian brain, digestive and immune activity [55,60,66] suggests that emerging Mn-dependent MCbgut+LB colonizers, adapted to the upper gut of ancestral vertebrates, could impact the feeding habits and behavior of their host, thereby influencing its evolution [85,86].Hence, a LB-driven feed forward loop may have contributed to diversify early vertebrate body plans, and turning to jawless vertebrates may be instructive in this regard. The sea lamprey has a life cycle comprising three distinct stages: blind larvae burrowing into the sand feeding on microbes and detritus by filtering surrounding water; the first metamorphosis rearranges sensory organs, forms a new esophagus and modifies the digestive system of free living juvenile lampreys that display high diet conversion efficiency and temperature-dependent growth; the second metamorphosis atrophies the intestine of fasting adults that die after spawning [87,88]. Apparently, the microbiota associated with growing wild juveniles is selectively enriched in LB,Streptococcusspp., in particular. Regarding hagfish gut microbiota, a close relative of LBWeissella cibaria(MCbgut+) was detected in wildEptatretus,while in captive specimens, MntH A+enterobacteria dominate (Figure S9). These data support the notion that gut LB could directly contribute to the growth and development of early vertebrates. However, continuous host development, perhaps tributary of further innovations such as jaws, heterodimeric hemoglobin and myelinization as well as the 2R genome allotetraploidization [39,40,78,89], was likely required to further vertebrate radiation and inflate marine biodiversity by fueling an evolutionary arms race toward ever more efficient predators [81,90].In sum, it is proposed that MCbgut+LB emerged in the upper gut of early vertebrates (ca. 540 mya, i.e., prior to vertebrate 1R WGD). LB colonization formed a novel holobiont that prefigured the final design of the gastro-intestinal tract of jawed vertebrates, whose development could benefit from boosted nutritional efficiency procured through LB\u2013host interactions. Establishing a feed forward loop for food access and tolerance could incentivize LB genome reduction and adaptation as Mn-dependent gastric aids, while their pro-gastric functions stimulated vertebrate Fe-dependent growth and development. Accordingly, LB evolution involved successive phases: (i) reductive, during marine MCbie+Bacillaceae adaptation to early vertebrate upper gut, leading to Mn-centric, acid-resistant fermentative cells (MCbgut+LB); and (ii) expansive, through the subsequent dissemination of MCbgut+LB adapting to novel niches, including terrestrial environments. Molecular communication between extant LB and the mammalian gut\u2013brain axis and immune system may include remnants of early vertebrate pro-gastric functions and subsequent interactions between more evolved organisms.4. Materials and MethodsProtein sequences were collected using NCBI and Uniprot repositories and BLAST programs (PHI-BLAST, TBLASTN and BLASTP, [91]). Sequences were curated using the MPI toolkit and the MMseqs2 program to retrieve sets of diverse seqs with reduced complexity [92]. ClustalX [93] seqs clustering and graphic display was used to unambiguously classify seqs into established phylogroups, using reference seqs [7].Each phylogenetic analysis was performed using a balanced set of groups of seqs to be analyzed plus a defined outgroup. Multiple seqs were aligned using Muscle [94] and the resulting alignments were manually edited using Seaview [95]. As needed, a Phylo-mLogo [96] display of the multiple sequence alignment was generated by writing a simple tree, aggregating clade-specific sets of seqs. Multiple sequence alignments were trimmed to eliminate sites with gaps or judged poorly informative in the Phylo-mLogo display, using Treecon [97]. Parsimony-informative sites were selected using Mega [98]. Tree calculations with IQ-Tree [99] used a number of categories of the free-rate heterogeneity model that was commensurate with the length of the parsimony-informative site alignment to estimate variations in substitution rate among sites using proportions of site categories and mixture substitution matrices [100]. Trees were displayed using FigTree (Version\u2014v1.4.4;http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/(accessed on 1 August 2024)) to appreciate the statistical robustness of tree nodes.Site selection for mutagenesis used defined phylogroups of aligned seqs to identify candidate type ii evolutionary rate-shifts, distinguishing the groups under study [4] based on the Sequence Harmony and Multi-Relief approaches [101]. Sites producing highly significant scores with both approaches were selected as sets of coevolved sites discriminating sister phylogroups. Reciprocal mutagenesis was performed by exchanging sets of phylogroup-specific residues between templates from each group. Additional mutations targeted sites defining the family of Slc11 carriers (Slc11 synapomorphy) as well as sites that characterize clades part of the Slc11 family. Every point mutation introduced was verified a posteriori with the returned seq of the predicted model. Differences in evolutionary rates between sister clades were also visualized using Consurf [102].3D modeling was performed using CF [11] with or without template (CFpdb and CFnt, respectively) and native seqs to identify the training model producing the best model, which was used to analyze corresponding mutant seqs [6]. AF2 models were retrieved from the Uniprot repository [103]. Molecular analyses using 2StrucCompare [104] allowed us to determine per residue the root mean square deviation of the Ca trace between pairs of aligned structures, which was visualized using spreadsheet software. The All Against All program (Dali EBI, [105]) was used to establish the 3D correspondence of groups of structures based on pairwise comparisons. POSA [106] was used to obtain multiple flexibly superimposed structures. Structures were visualized using Pymol (DeLano, W.L.

        "abstract": "Nipple fruit (Solanum mammosum), teosinte (Dioon mejiae), Caesar mushroom (Amanita caesarea), and weevil (Rhynchophorus palmarum) powders have shown great nutritional content with meaningful dietary applications. This study aspired to investigate the impact of nipple fruit, teosinte, Caesar mushroom, and weevil powders on the bile tolerance, acid tolerance, lysozyme tolerance, gastric juice resistance, and protease activity of Lactobacillus casei. Nipple fruit, teosinte, Caesar mushroom, and weevil powders were combined at 2% (wt/vol), whereas the control samples did not include the ingredients. The bile and acid tolerances were analyzed in Difco De Man\u2013Rogosa\u2013Sharpe broth incubated under aerobic conditions at 37 \u00b0C. The bile tolerance was investigated by adding 0.3% oxgall, whereas the acid tolerance was studied by modifying the pH to 2.0. The lysozyme tolerance was studied in electrolyte solution containing lysozyme (100 mg/L), while the gastric juice tolerance was analyzed at pH levels of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. The protease activity was studied spectrophotometrically at 340 nm in skim milk incubated under aerobic conditions at 37 \u00b0C. The results show that nipple fruit increased the counts, whereas Caesar mushroom and weevil powders resulted in lower counts for bile tolerance, acid tolerance, lysozyme resistance, and simulated gastric juice tolerance characteristics. Furthermore, the protease activity increased by adding nipple fruit to skim milk. According to the results, nipple fruit may improve the characteristics of L. casei in cultured dairy by-products.",

        "content": "1. IntroductionLactobacillus caseistrains are autochthonous microorganisms associated with the human host [1].L. caseiis a probiotic bacterium that effectively balances intestinal microflora, regulates intestinal disorders, controls the immune system, modulates the cellular immune response, and has a potent antidiarrheal action [2]. Industrially,L. caseihas applications as probiotics in humans, as an acid-producing starter culture for milk fermentations, and especially as cultures for the intensification and acceleration of flavor development in certain varieties of probiotic yogurt [3].L. caseimay regulate gastrointestinal disorders caused by pathogenic bacteria.L. caseiimproves digestion and reactions to milk. The probiotic strain improves lactose digestion and stimulates a healthy gut microbiota, which is critical for digestive health. As a probiotic,L. caseiimproves digestion, reduces symptoms of lactose intolerance, strengthens the immune system, and relieves constipation. In addition, it participates in the production and optimizes the absorption of B and K vitamins.L. caseihas demonstrated potential in restoring the intestinal barrier function and intestinal microbiota compromised by anti-inflammatory drugs. Its use also promotes positive results for some diseases related to the digestive tract and chronic infectious diseases, as well as in obesity and patients with depression.L. caseisupports neutrophilic function and insulin resistance in obese patients, promoting the reduction of metabolic endotoxemia and altering the composition of the intestinal flora and intestinal permeability.L. caseialleviates cytokine-induced epithelial barrier dysfunctions in intestinal epithelial cells [3].It was proposed to carry out a study with the purpose of evaluating whether the continued consumption of milk fermented withLactobacillus casei(DN-114001) showed a beneficial effect on the incidence of the most common infectious disorders in children. The probiotics that have demonstrated the greatest efficacy in treating diarrhea areL. rhamnosus,S. boulardii, andLactococcus lactis, and those that have demonstrated the greatest efficacy in preventing acute diarrhea areS. boulardii,L. rhamnosusGG,B. lactis, andS. thermophiles. The probiotics reduce the duration of symptoms when diarrhea is already established and prevent its onset when there has been recent and close contact with someone who has experienced acute viral diarrhea. Furthermore, optimistic findings have been delivered from some studies onL. caseiand other lactobacilli probiotics, such asLactobacillus bulgaricusandStreptococcus thermophilus, for treating diarrhea induced byClostridium difficile[4]. However, the WHO has demonstrated that the advantages related to probiotics are strain-dependent; their outcomes rely on the strain utilized.L. caseiprevents impaired barrier function in intestinal epithelial cells [5]. Other studies have reported that even dead cells can stop the development of intestinal inflammation by maintaining and modulating the intestinal barrier [6].It has been shown that the quality and quantity of dietary components actively regulate the microbiome of the intestine, with implications on mood, stress, and anxiety and possible therapeutic effects derived from its modulation with probiotics. (L. acidophilus,L. casei, andB. Bifidum) However, more prospective studies in humans are required to plan comprehensive and personalized dietary interventions [6].The nipple fruit (Solanum mammosum) [7], teosinte (Dioon mejiae) [8], Caesar mushroom (Amanita caesarea) [9], and weevil (Rhynchophorus palmarum) were carefully studied for theirL. acidophilusattributes. The nipple fruit (Solanum mammosum) [7], teosinte (Dioon mejiae) [8], and Caesar mushroom (Amanita caesarea) [9] are ideal fiber, mineral, and protein sources. However, the palm weevil (Rhynchophorus palmarum L.) seems to be abundant in polyunsaturated fatty acids such as PUFA n3/omega-3 [10].There is no research onL. caseiproperties as influenced by these ingredients.L. caseiis a gram-positive bacteria used as a probiotic for fermented products, and this probiotic enhances the metabolism and improves gut microbiota. As a result, the current study aims to observe the effects of different food sources onL. caseiattributes.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Plant MaterialPostharvest samples of the nipple fruit (Solanum mammosum), teosinte (Dioon mejiae), and Caesar mushroom (Amanita caesarea) were collected at different times and years in the Guapinol Biological Reserve, Marcovia Municipality, Choluteca Department (Honduras). The plant materials were dried in the shade at room temperature for 20 days and then ground to a powder. Individually, plant material solution (10% wt./wt.) was freeze-dried (LIOTOP model L 101, S\u00e3o Carlos-SP, Brazil) for 48 h at \u221275 \u00b0C and 0.5 Pa. The weevils were dried (Digitronic TFT- Selecta, J.P. SELECTA, Barcelona, Spain) at 50 \u00b0C/48 h and were grounded in a Retsch SM 100 knife mill (Retsch GmbH, Haan, Germany) (501\u2013700 mm) [11].2.2. Tolerance to Bile SaltA 1% culture ofL. casei(Danisco, DairyConnection, Madison, WI, USA) was used in peptone water (0.1% w/v) at room temperature (21 \u00b0C). The cultures were added to a solution that was prepared with 0.925 g of Difco De Man\u2013Rogosa\u2013Sharpe (MRS) broth, 20 mL of distilled water, 0.05 g of bile salts, and 0.5 g of the ingredients. The control samples did not contain the ingredients. MRS agar was used as a growth medium for the bacteria, and a solution of 82.5 g of MRS, 22.5 g of agar, and 1500 mL of distilled water was prepared. Later, the pH was adjusted to 5.2, and the solution was mixed and boiled (100 \u00b0C). A lactose solution of 0.625 g in 25 mL of distilled water was prepared. Finally, the inoculation was carried out using 2.5 mL of culture and 5 mL of lactose in the mother solution to treat the treatments and the control samples. The analysis was carried out in serial solutions, and plating was carried out at hourly intervals (0, 4, and 8 h) to determine the resistance of the bacteria together with the ingredients. The experiment was carried out in three repetitions. Once the hours of incubation were completed (72 h), the bacteria were counted to find the countable plate (25 to 250 CFU) [12].2.3. Acid ToleranceFor this analysis, the same procedure used for the tolerance to bile salts was used, with small modifications in the broths and the sowing times. For this analysis, bile salts were not used, but the pH of the broths was adjusted to 2 to simulate the acidity of the digestive system. The time intervals were 0, 30 min, and 1 h forL. casei. The sowing time intervals were 0, 15, and 30 min [12].2.4. Tolerance to Gastric JuicesL. casei(10%v/v) was inoculated in an electrolyte solution with H2O, pepsin 0.32% (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), and NaCl 0.2%. The pH was set up with NaOH and HCl. The electrolyte solution was prepared at pH levels of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7. After the inoculation, the culture media was incubated in anaerobic conditions at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. After 30 min of growth, 1 mL was taken and enumerated in 10-fold diluted peptone water and plated in duplicate with MRS agar. The inoculum was enumerated at 0 and 30 min to determine the colony-forming units by duplicated plate reading [13,14]. All determinations were made in triplicate.2.5. Lysozyme ActivityThe activity of the lysozyme enzyme has the same principle of acid tolerance and tolerance to bile salts in the use of peptone water and agars for each of the bacteria, with certain modifications in the preparation of the samples. For the elaboration of this analysis, 20 mL of distilled water, 0.04 g of calcium chloride, 0.12 g of hydrochloric sodium, 0.03 g of sodium bicarbonate, 0.04 g of hydrochloric potassium, and 0.5 g of ingredients were used; a control containing no percentage of ingredients was also used for this analysis. The solution for the enzyme was prepared in 10 mL of distilled water using 10 mg of the powdered lysozyme. In addition, 2.5 mL of the bacteria plus 2.5 mL of the lysozyme solution were inoculated into the bottles containing the sample and the control [15].2.6. Protease ActivityTo analyze proteolytic activity, 8.8 mL of skim milk (previously sterilized in an autoclave) was placed in a test tube, and 0.2 g of ingredients was added; a control that did not contain the ingredients powder was also used. The o-phthalaldehyde (OPA) reagent was prepared, which was made up of different reagent solutions, starting with the 560 mg OPA solution plus 14 mL of distilled water, then 35 mL of sodium dodecyl sulfate was added, a second 13.38 solution of sodium borate was prepared, and 350 mL of distilled water added. Finally, the solutions and reagents were mixed, and, later, 1.4 mL of 2-mercaptoethanol was added and the OPA reagent was obtained; this reagent was placed in a volumetric flask covered with aluminum foil to prevent its evaporation by light. For this analysis, a reagent was also prepared with 83.53 g of trichloroacetic acid and 1100 mL of distilled water, which was used for the 3 repetitions of the study. In addition, 1 mL of the culture (L. casei) was inoculated in the test tubes, and, later, 2.5 mL of the sample, 1 mL of distilled water, and 5 mL of trichloroacetic acid were added to another test tube; this solution was filtered for 10 min using filter paper. Once filtered, 0.15 mL of the sample was placed in a cuvette to which 3 mL of the OPA reagent was previously added, after which the cuvette was placed in the spectrophotometer to obtain the amount of absorbance of the sample. This analysis was carried out in time intervals of 0, 12, and 24 h, in which the same sample preparation procedure was repeated and the absorbance was measured using a spectrophotometer (340 nm) (Nicolet Evolution 100, Thermo Scientific; Madison, WI, USA) [16].2.7. Statistical AnalysisData were analyzed using Statistical Analysis Systems (SASs) and examined using the general linear model. Differences of least square means were utilized to examine significant differences for the ingredient effect, time effect, and ingredient \u00d7 time effect. A Tukey\u2019s test was utilized to define the statistical disparities among the ingredient effect, time effect, and ingredient \u00d7 time effect at \u03b1 = 0.05.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Bile ToleranceBile is a yellow-green liquid essential for digesting fats and removing worn red blood cells and certain toxins from the body. Bile is stored in the gallbladder, and it contains minerals, cholesterol, fats, phospholipids, bile pigments, and bile acids. Bile secretion is synthesized and secreted by the hepatocyte into the bile ducts, which drain into the hepatic duct. Bile performs crucial biological functions, such as promoting the use of fats as a natural emulsifier, activating lipase, improving the digestibility of fats, and protecting the liver. After a meal, bile is secreted into the small intestine [17].Bile acids have the biological activity of regulating the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins, cholesterol, and lipids. Bile salts make it possible to emulsify fats. It must be remembered that fats are not water-soluble, so bile emulsifies them; that is, it converts them into a suspension of tiny droplets so that the mucous membranes can more easily absorb them.The most useful components of bile are bile acids (a class of steroids) and lecithin (a phospholipid), which coat dietary fat globules and facilitate their digestion. Micelles are like small droplets made by the liver and carried through the bile duct. The small intestine absorbs fatty acids, monoglycerides, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K). The components fit onto the surface of the absorbing cells of the intestinal wall, discharge their contents into the cells to be processed, and repeat the process until all the fats and nutrients in a meal have been absorbed [17]. Nevertheless, the bile salts can inhibit the growth of probiotics [18].Figure 1shows the bile tolerance ofL. caseiover 8 h after incorporating the ingredients. The interaction effect (ingredient concentration \u00d7 time) was not significant (p> 0.05), while the time (hour) effect and ingredient effect were significant (p< 0.05) (Table 1andTable 2).The nipple fruit improved the bile tolerance ofL. casei, and the growth decreased over time. Caesar mushroom and weevil powders resulted in significantly (p< 0.05) lower counts. The growth remained stable until 4 h and significantly (p< 0.05) decreased at 8 h. This is a good result since the high antioxidant capacity of this fruit [18] at this concentration does not cause a marked inhibition of the development ofL. casei. Other reports examined the bile tolerance ofL. acidophilusand concluded that nipple fruit improved the growth in MRS broth [19]. Furthermore, for other plants, such as carao (Cassia grandis), Paz et al. (2022) [20] reported the bile tolerance ofL. bulgaricusover 8 h of incubation in MRS broth, with it having 0.03% oxgall and improvement with growth. In addition, Aleman et al. (2023) showed that Caesar mushroom and weevil powders inhibit the growth of L. acidophilus under oxgall salt (0.03%) in MRS broth [21]. The bile in the gallbladder originates in the liver. It is a greenish-to-brownish liquid composed of water, cholesterol, phospholipids (a type of fat), bile salts, proteins, and bilirubin. Bilirubin is the product of the breakdown of hemoglobin in the liver and gives bile its yellowish color. The liver eliminates toxins, excess cholesterol, and impurities of one kind [22]. It is important that functional ingredients can improve the probiotic bile tolerance to improve cultured foods\u2019 nutritional profile.3.2. Acid Tolerance and Resistance to Gastrointestinal JuicesThe acid tolerance was studied at a pH of 2 to examine the effect of the ingredients on the log counts ofL. casei, simulating stomach conditions [23]. The stomach produces hydrochloric acid to digest food. The acidity of gastric juice is due to hydrochloric acid secreted by the stomach\u2019s parietal cells. It is essential for activating pepsinogen, which is transformed into pepsin and initiates protein degradation and digestion [24].Gastric juice is a clear liquid abundantly secreted by numerous microscopic glands scattered throughout the stomach mucosa. These juices are a highly corrosive mixture of various chemicals: hydrochloric acid, water, electrolytes (potassium, calcium, and sodium), and enzymes called pepsins. Its highly corrosive action, and the contraction movements carried out by the stomach make digestion possible. Its function is to help digest proteins. Due to the presence of hydrochloric acid, the pH takes a value between one and two. This acid environment facilitates the breakdown of proteins to convert them into smaller units. Its pepsin and renin enzymes favor the absorption of nutrients in the small intestine because they break down proteins into smaller subunits that are easier to digest. The stomach is capable of secreting gastric juices each day to break down the food and turn it into a pasty substance called chyme, from which the small intestine obtains the necessary nutrients for the body, and then it pours into the bloodstream [24].The acid tolerance and resistance to gastrointestinal juices ofL. caseias impacted by the ingredients are shown inFigure 2andFigure 3. For the acid tolerance and resistance to gastrointestinal juices, the interaction effect (ingredient \u00d7 time) was not significant (p> 0.05), whereas the time (minutes) effect and ingredient effect were significant (p< 0.05) (Table 1andTable 2). The nipple fruit improved the acid tolerance ofL. casei, while Caesar mushroom and weevil powders resulted in significantly (p< 0.05) lower counts, and the growth decreased over time. The growth significantly (p< 0.05) decreased at 0 to 10 min and remained stable from 10 to 15 min.Aleman et al. (2023) [19] examined the acid tolerance of L. acidophilus and concluded that nipple fruit improved the growth in MRS broth. In addition, Aleman et al. (2023) [21] showed that Caesar mushroom and weevil powders inhibit the growth of L. acidophilus under acidic conditions. The buffering capacity of potential compounds in the nipple fruit could prevent bacteria decay under acidified conditions. The pH is an essential factor influencing the growth of microorganisms. Some bacteria generally grow at a low pH (3.0), and fungi thrive at a low pH (1.0) [25]. However, the optimum pH range for bacteria is 6.0 to 8.5, and few prefer a pH of 8.5 or higher. Fungi can grow in media with a pH of up to 8.5. Still, most of them like an acidic pH and can alter the pH of an unbuffered medium by the products they generate during their growth, as occurs with some of the bacteria [26]. Acid tolerance is considered a significant property in selecting potential bacteria as probiotics [27]. The results show the prospect of nipple fruit to enhance the tolerance ofL. caseiin the small intestine, where the pH varies from pH 6 to 7.4.3.3. Resistance to LysozymeLysozyme, or muramidase, is an enzyme found in most mammals, including humans. Lysozyme has a bactericidal function by hydrolyzing peptidoglycan in bacterial cell walls; it primarily acts by weakening the cell wall rather than causing cell damage directly. It facilitates bacterial lysis and can enhance the bacterial susceptibility to other antimicrobial agents or phagocytosis by immune cells. It is found in secretions such as tears, mucus, or saliva; it is also found in large amounts in human breast milk and can be found in organs such as the spleen or lungs, tissues such as bone cartilage, and blood [28]. Antimicrobial enzymes that have been studied are, among others, proteolytic, oxidative, and those with the ability to hydrolyze polysaccharides, including amylases, lyases, Dispersin B, and lysozymes [28]. In particular, the activity of lysozymes against various microorganisms has been widely reported due to their ability to hydrolyze the polymers present in the cell walls of bacteria, specifically those belonging to the gram (+) group [29]. Recent studies have also reported this enzyme\u2019s ability to hydrolyze microorganisms\u2019 cell walls [30,31,32]. Likewise, its effectiveness as an antibacterial and antifungal agent has been reported when combined with other active compounds [33,34,35,36]. Resistance to lysozyme is shown inFigure 4. The ingredient and time effects were significant (p< 0.05), whereas the interaction effect (ingredient \u00d7 time) was not significant (p> 0.05) (Table 1andTable 2). The interaction effect was insignificant (p> 0.05), meaning the control and nipple fruit samples followed the same trend. The log counts of the control and nipple fruit samples decreased over time.For the control and nipple fruit treatments, the log counts decreased from 0 to 60 min and remained stable from 60 to 120 min. The nipple fruit treatments reported a significantly (p< 0.05) higher viability than the control samples (Table 2). However, Caesar mushroom and weevil powders resulted in significantly (p< 0.05) lower counts. Nipple fruit have considerable amounts of sucrose [21], and this substrate could be used for the survivability ofL. casei. Furthermore, Aleman et al. (2023) [19] examined the acid lysozyme ofL. acidophilusand concluded that nipple fruit improved its growth in MRS broth. Paz et al. (2022) [20] also reported that carao improved the acid and bile tolerance ofL. bulgaricusin MRS broth. In addition, Aleman et al. (2023) showed that Caesar mushroom and weevil powders inhibit the growth ofL. acidophilusin an electrolyte solution with lysozyme [21]. Lysozyme destroys the peptidoglycan barrier, an important cytoplasmic membrane element [37]. Lysozymes are enzymes, and they are typically found in the extracellular environment or within certain cells [38]. Lysozymes are involved in various cellular processes [39]. They are in charge of recycling waste cell debris [39].3.4. Protease ActivityProteases, present in all living organisms, catalyze the hydrolysis of peptide bonds in proteins. They are grouped according to the amino acid residues of the active site and the mechanisms of action into five groups: serine, cysteine, aspartic, metalloproteases, and peptidases of an unknown catalytic mechanism [40]. The protease activity ofL. caseiis illustrated inFigure 5. The ingredient and time effects were significant (p< 0.05), whereas the interaction effect (ingredient \u00d7 time) was not significant (p> 0.05) (Table 1andTable 2), indicating that the nipple fruit samples obeyed a similar trend to control samples. The control and ingredient samples improved the growth over time. The protease activity ofL. caseiimproved the growth after 24 h for the control and nipple fruit treatments (Figure 5). All treatments showed no significant difference (p> 0.05) from the control samples at 0 h and 12 h, whereas nipple fruit treatments had significantly higher protease activity at 24 h. Nipple fruit has substantial quantities of sucrose, which could improve the growth ofL. casei, contributing to a more elevated protease activity. The main and general function of proteolysis is to break down the protein molecules in the food that are digested into the smallest amino acids that the body can use. The process is also necessary for the production of active proteins from synthesized polypeptide chains. Proteolysis is also involved in flavor and odor formation and assists in giving desired textural properties [40].4. ConclusionsPrebiotics and probiotics are the two most well-known and studied functional food ingredients that can benefit similarly by promoting intestinal health. The probiotic characteristics ofL. caseiwere tested and investigated. This study delved into a captivating area of study, focusing on the effects of nipple fruit, teosinte, Caesar mushroom, and weevil powders on the bile tolerance, acid tolerance, lysozyme tolerance, gastric juice resistance, and protease activity ofLactobacillus casei. This study\u2019s findings reveal that nipple fruit positively impacted the viability ofL. casei, while Caesar mushroom and weevil powders showed negative effects on bile tolerance, acid tolerance, lysozyme resistance, and simulated gastric juice tolerance characteristics. Consequently, nipple fruit may enhance the characteristics ofL. caseiin cultured dairy by-products. Also, the protease activity was improved by adding nipple fruit to skim milk. Some of these novel food sources, alongsideL. casei, can be used in developing new fermented dairy products for health purposes. According to the results, nipple fruit may improve the characteristics ofL. caseiin cultured dairy by-products. Further studies, such as on the probiotic properties of nipple fruit in in vivo models, should be carried out to determine the applications ofL. caseiwith nipple fruit in cultured products.Author ContributionsConceptualization, R.S.A. and A.K.; methodology, R.S.A., F.D., J.M. and M.S.; software, R.S.A. and J.M.; formal analysis, R.S.A.

New Definitions of a Genus with a Large Number of MicroorganismsThe genusBacillusbelongs to the Bacteria Kingdom, Firmicutes Phylum,BacilliClass,BacillalesOrder, andBacillaceaeFamily. It was created in 1872 by Cohn, who renamedVibrio subtilisasBacillus subtilis, which is a type species of this taxonomic group [1]. For years, this taxon consisted of a heterogeneous group of microorganisms. This heterogeneity was mainly due to the lax criteria used in the past when assigning a genus to various species capable of forming spores in the presence of oxygen [2].The revision of the genus was conducted through studies of 16S rRNA, which allowed for the characterization of phylogenetic groups that were subsequently reclassified. An example of this is the study conducted by Ash et al., who, based on the phylogenetic analysis of the sequences of 51 species within the genusBacillus, identified five clusters [3]. One of these clusters contained the type species, which they calledBacillus sensu stricto, while the other four were later reclassified into the generaBrevibacillus,Geobacillus,Lysinibacillus, andPaenibacillus[2].Subsequently, phylogenetic analyses based on the sequences of other genes/proteins began to be conducted. By 2018, the genus consisted of more than 280 species; however, extensive polyphyly was observed among many of its members, who had little in common [4,5,6]. Based on phylogenetic analysis, Gupta et al. proposed the reclassification of 17 clades containing species classified asBacillusinto new genera:Alteribacter,Ectobacillus,Evansella,Ferdinandcohnia,Gottfriedia,Heyndrickxia,Lederbergia,Litchfieldia,Margalitia,Niallia,Priesti, Robertmurraya,Rossellomorea,Schinkia,Siminovitchia,Sutcliffiella, andWeizmannia[7].Additionally, Patel and Gupta usedcoreand other conserved proteins to conduct phylogenetic and comparative genetic sequence analyses, defining the members of the Subtilis and Cereus clades as well as six additional genera:Alkalihalobacillus,Cytobacillus,Neobacillus,Mesobacillus,Metabacillus, andPeribacillus[2]. They also proposed that new species added to the genusBacillusshould meet the minimum criteria of the Subtilis or Cereus clades and be supported by a phylogenetic tree based on 16S rRNA sequences or by concatenated protein sequences. The \u201cSubtilis clade\u201d, which originally consisted ofB. subtilis,B. licheniformis,B. pumilus, andB. amyloliquefaciens, has since expanded to include several species related to these members [8]. This group contains the type species and representatives of theBacillussensu stricto genus. The \u201cCereus clade\u201d (Cereus group sensu lato) comprises the pathogenic species of the genus, such asBacillus anthracis, which can cause fatal disease;Bacillus cereussensu stricto, a foodborne pathogen; andBacillus thuringiensis, an entomopathogen, along with non-pathogenic species that have significant applications in agriculture and industry.Additionally, [9] proposed a nomenclatural framework for theBacillus cereusgroup that includes: genomospecies defined using resolvable clusters obtained at 92.5 ANI; established medically relevant lineages with a formal collection of subspecies names; and the heterogeneity of clinically and industrially significant phenotypes with a formalized and extended collection of biovar terms. This framework delineates seven genomospecies: (I)Bacillus pseudomycoides, (II)Bacillus paramycoides, (III)Bacillus mosaicus, (IV)Bacillus cereussensu stricto, (V)Bacillus toyonensis, (VI)Bacillus mycoides, (VII)Bacillus cytotoxicus, and (VIII)Bacillus luti.Currently, the genusBacilluscomprises 435 species and 12 subspecies (with validated publication and correct nomenclature), which are grouped based on 16S rRNA analysis as well as other genes and protein sequences into two distinct clades organized into phylogenetic trees that are not phylogenetically related to each other (List of Prokaryotic names withstanding in Nomenclature, [10]. This genus, subject to constant modifications, has recently validated species such asB. arachidis,B. changyiensis,B. dafuensis,B. daqingensis,B. dicomae, andB. basilensis[11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19].2. Alternatives in Species IdentificationGiven the high genetic homology among members of this genus [20] whole-genome sequencing would be ideal for identifying species; however, it is not always feasible. In such cases, sequencing therrsgene that codes for 16S rRNA with subsequent analysis as a sole methodology does not always constitute an adequate tool for the identification of these microorganisms [3,21,22]. It has been shown that 93.93% ofBacillusgenus members contain multiple copies of the 16S rRNA gene, and 55.32% of 16S alleles are identical to those of other species [20]. Meanwhile, Mohkam et al. combined the results obtained from 16S rRNA sequencing with the analysis of the sequences of therpoB andrecA genes, which code for the \u03b2 subunit of RNA polymerase and a recombinase, respectively, along with the RAPD-PCR technique for the identification ofBacillusspecies, obtaining better results than using 16S rRNA sequencing alone [22]. Regarding the DNA gyrase gene (gyrA), Liu et al. developed new primers (gyrA3) that offer enhanced identification and typing capabilities compared to those formulated by [23,24] (gyrA1 andgyrA2) [25]. WhilegyrA1 andgyrA2 primarily detectB. subtilis,gyrA3 is capable of identifying at least 92Bacillusspecies, including various species from both clades and related taxa. Furthermore,gyrA3 enabled more detailed subspecies-level clustering forB. amyloliquefaciens,B. pumilus, andB. megaterium, a level of resolution not achieved forB. anthracis. The limitations in species detection are related to the high variability in protein-coding housekeeping gene sequences, which complicates the development of universal sequencing primers [26]. Recently, Xu et al. designed primers for the gene encoding the elongation factor thermo-unstable (EF-Tu) [27]. These primers were specific to the genusBacillusand were able to successfully differentiate species both in silico and in vitro.In this regard, strategies have been developed to identify members of both clades. Since the Cereus group consists of pathogenic species as well as others of importance in agriculture and industry, the identification of bacterial species is essential for assessing public health risk and industrial utility [28]. The virulence factors of pathogenic members of the group are mostly encoded on plasmids, which can be lost; moreover, these virulence factors can be shared among species, complicating diagnosis by traditional molecular methods, such as PCR. Porcellato et al. observed that the analysis of the pantoate-beta-alanine ligase (panC) gene sequence has strong discriminatory power for species identification within theB. cereusgroup [29]. In search of a simple and straightforward assay, Ateiah et al. developed a method for detecting unamplified bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA using a DNA nanomachine (DNM) [30]. This approach aims to simplify the analysis of biological RNA samples and offers potential utility for environmental monitoring. Another significant advancement in the identification of members within this group is the methodology proposed by Tourasse et al., who introduced the first core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) scheme involving 1568 core genes for the entireB. cereusgroup, includingB. cytotoxicus, which functions as an outgroup [31]. This scheme has been implemented in the PubMLST resource. The new cgMLST system provides unparalleled resolution compared to existing phylogenetic analysis methods for theB. cereusgroup. With regard to whole genome analysis, Chug et al. evaluated several tools used for the identification ofBacillus thuringiensisfrom whole genome sequencing [32]. They found that IDOPS predicted crystal protein production with the highest sensitivity.In reference to the Subtilis clade, Lim et al. complemented 16S rRNA sequencing with theytcP gene for the identification ofB. subtilis[33]. Heo et al. suggests that using thegmkgene, a highly conserved gene that codes for the enzyme guanylate kinase, as an alternative to differentiateB. velezensisfrom other closely related species [34]. The polymerase chain reaction is used in other species of this genus, such asB. amyloliquefaciens, which is based on the gene encoding \u03b1-amylase present in this microorganism. However, although there is a PCR method used for its identification, this gene is not always present in all strains belonging to this species [35,36]. On the other hand, Xu et al. emphasize the high specificity of thegyrA andrpoB primers intra-specifically within theB. subtilisgroup [27].Regarding proteomic methodologies, mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF), whether used alone or in combination with other techniques, has been useful for identifying microorganisms from both clades [37,38,39,40]. However, sample preparation remains a critical factor. Janiszewska et al. explored the crucial role of sample preparation in the identification ofBacillusspecies using MALDI-TOF [41]. Although they did not find significant differences between the methods used (the ethanol/formic acid extraction method and extended direct transfer involving the analysis of whole bacterial cells treated with formic acid), they determined that the optimal incubation period for accurate identification ranges from 1 to 12 h.3. Reformulation of the Description of the GenusBacillusspp.Based on these restructurings, the description of the genus initially made by Cohn has been reformulated. The genusBacillusconsists of bacteria with a straight or slightly curved rod morphology, ranging in size from 0.5-2.5 \u00b5m in diameter by 1.2\u201310 \u00b5m in lenght, which can occur singly or in chains of varying lengths [42]. Most species belonging to this genus are Gram-positive, with a few exceptions that are Gram-variable [7]. These bacteria are generally motile by peritrichous flagella, except forB. anthracisand some strains ofB. cereus. Capsule formation is observed in some strains under certain conditions, being polysaccharide in nature forB. mycoidesandB. pumilus, whileB. anthracis,B. subtilis, andB. licheniformisproduce poly-\u0264-D-glutamic acid capsules [42]. Additionally,B. anthracisand some strains ofB. cereusproduce an S-layer [43].Most species form endospores in response to nutritional or environmental stress, which are resistant to heat, cold, ionizing radiation, desiccation, and many disinfectants [44,45,46]. The spores can be oval, cylindrical, or ellipsoidal, and even kidney- or banana-shaped in some strains of certain species, with central, subterminal, or terminal localizations, without deforming the bacterial cell body [42].Regarding their habitat, these microorganisms are ubiquitous and can be isolated from various environments, most commonly soil and plants. However, other sources include food, clinical samples, animal origins, and marine environments.The genus comprises aerobic bacteria; however, some members are facultative anaerobes. They are not nutritionally demanding.Bacillusspp. grows on nutrient agar or peptone media, showing ideal growth at a neutral pH. Nevertheless, some species can grow at a pH of 9, while others can tolerate a pH of 2 [47]. Their growth temperature ranges from 10 to 45 \u00b0C, with optimal growth occurring between 30 and 40 \u00b0C [7]. Some species can grow in the presence of NaCl concentrations greater than 7% (w/v). Colony morphology is variable, and some species can produce pigments under certain culture conditions. They are chemoorganotrophic microorganisms, metabolizing organic substances such as amino acids, organic acids, and sugars through aerobic and anaerobic respiration or fermentation, depending on the species and environment [47].4.Bacillus subtilis: The Most Studied Species of the GenusThe designation of the speciesBacillus subtilisrefers to a morphological characteristic of this microorganism, as the term \u201csubtilis\u201d is derived from Latin and means fine or thin. This species has been the most extensively studied within the genusBacillus. It was the first Gram-positive microorganism to have its genome sequenced, which consists of a single chromosome of 4.2 Mbp with a G + C content of 43%, containing approximately 4200 genes, of which 253 are essential for its cultivation in the laboratory [48].Bacillus subtilisis characterized by being Gram-positive bacilli, measuring 0.7\u20130.8 \u00b5m in diameter by 2\u20133 \u00b5m in lenght, which can be found singly or in pairs, rarely in chains. They are motile due to peritrichous flagellation with a low number of flagella [42]. Their vegetative cell wall features glucan of extreme lengths with typical peptide links bound to N-acetylmuramic acid (meso-diaminopimelic acid direct), teichoic and lipoteichoic acids (comprising 60% of the wall), teichuronic acid, and sugar phosphate polymers [49].The cell wall of the endospores has a different composition, possessing a thin inner layer closely attached to the inner membrane of the forespore (similar in composition to the vegetative cell) and a thick chemically distinct outer layer called the cortex, which is adjacent to the outer membrane of the forespore [49]. Although it does not always produce a visible capsule under laboratory conditions, it has been observed that theB. subtilis168 strain encodes a capsule in its genome that is both polysaccharide and polyglutamic in nature [42].This species was one of the first to have the process of sporulation studied. Its spores are cylindrical to ellipsoidal, with a central, paracentral, or terminal location and do not deform the bacterial soma. They are easily transported by air, dispersed by wind, and can survive high temperatures, desiccation, UV radiation, and gamma radiation [42,44].B. subtilisis aerobic, not nutritionally demanding, it has an optimal growth temperature between 28 and 30 \u00b0C and can grow in a range of 5 to 55 \u00b0C, with a pH range of 5.5 to 8.5. It can grow in the presence of up to 7% NaCl, with some strains tolerating up to 10%. Colony morphology is variable among and within strains, sometimes appearing as a mixed culture. Colonies range from 2 to 4 mm in size, are round to irregular with wavy to fimbriated margins, and have opaque surfaces that can be rough. Generally, they are whitish but can be pigmented in yellow, orange, pink, red, brown, or black. Texture varies, being moist, mucous, membranous, or rough as they dry.This microorganism has been isolated from various environments, ranging from soil to marine habitats [42]. Due to its frequent presence in dried grass, it was historically referred to as \u201chay bacillus or grass bacillus\u201d. It has also been isolated from compost, moth larvae, flies, plant tissues, leather, poultry waste and feces, paper, cardboard, gemstones, and the surfaces of ancient stone monuments. The ubiquitous nature ofB. subtilisis attributed not only to spore dispersion, but also to its ability to grow in diverse environments, including soil, plant roots, and within the gastrointestinal tracts of animals [44].B. subtilisis known for producing a significant number of secondary metabolites, as 4% of its genome is dedicated to their production, as well as enzymes and volatile organic compounds. Some of these compounds are potent inhibitors of fungi and bacteria, allowingB. subtilisto compete effectively in natural environments by degrading molecules to incorporate nutrients. These properties have been utilized by various industries, makingB. subtilisvaluable for applications, such as growth promotion, and as a probiotic [44].5. Sporulation as a Form of Resistance to Adverse EnvironmentsThe genusBacillusis characterized by its ability to form spores in response to adverse conditions, which have been shown to possess resistance to heat, desiccation, and radiation [46,50,51]. Particularly, the speciesB. subtilishas been studied as a model for the sporulation process.The spore possesses a complex structure that differs from the vegetative cell. The synthesis of the various layers that constitute the spore is a gradual process that begins shortly after the stage of septation. It consists of a thin outer layer of glycoprotein nature called the exosporium, present only in some species. InB. cereus,B. anthracis, andB. thuringiensis, the exosporium has hair-like projections [52]. The exosporium contributes to protection against macromolecules, such as hydrolytic enzymes and antibodies, and provides the spore with resistance to oxidative stress produced by macrophages [53]. Beneath this layer are multiple protein layers called the spore coat, which are crucial for resistance to chemicals and show great diversity among individuals in the proteins that constitute it [52,54]. Between these two layers is the interspace [52]. Below the coat is the outer membrane, which acts as a selective permeability barrier. Following this is the cortex, composed of peptidoglycan with unique features, such as loose linkages, and the presence of muramic \u03b4-lactam (MAL). Beneath the cortex lies the spore core, or protoplast, which contains a structure akin to a vegetative cell. This core features a cell wall, a cytoplasmic membrane (spore inner membrane), and cytoplasm, wherein the DNA, ribosomes, and the majority of the spore\u2019s enzymes are situated [55]. Within the spore, a characteristic substance is calcium dipicolinate (CaDPA). The spore protoplast contains only 10 to 30% of the water content of the vegetative cell, conferring heat resistance, chemical resistance (e.g., to hydrogen peroxide), and inactivation of certain enzymes present in the spore. Additionally, heat resistance is due to the presence of a functional cortex and DNA-repairing enzymes that operate under extreme heat, such as RecA [52].Another characteristic of spores is that they have a pH one unit lower than the vegetative cell and specific proteins called small, acid-soluble spore proteins (SASPs) [56]. SASPs bind to DNA, protecting it from radiation, heat, and desiccation, and serve as a source of carbon and energy for the cell during germination. In the case ofB. subtilis, the presence of CotA, a copper-dependent laccase, has been observed on the outer part of the coat, contributing to protection against UV radiation and peroxide [52].The time it takes for the sporulation process to develop can vary between species and even between strains. Some microorganisms have high sporulation rates, while others have low rates. [57] studied the sporulation percentage in strains belonging to different species of the genusBacillusand observed better sporulation rates at 72 h in strains ofB. amyloliquefacienssubsp.plantarum,B. mojavensis, andB. subtilis.Due to their high resistance, spores have become products of interest in biotechnology. The speciesB. subtilishas been extensively studied. Among its applications, its use as a platform for producing recombinants proteins, including vaccines, vaccine adjuvants, and the production of nanobodies, as well as platforms for increasing the thermostability of certain enzymes, can be mentioned [58].6.Bacillusspp.: Producer of a Wide Variety of MoleculesBacillusspp. can produce many antimicrobial substances, lytic enzymes, and volatile organic compounds, providing an alternative to the use of agrochemicals for phytopathogen control [59]. Furthermore, it has been observed to act on crops by secreting exopolysaccharides and siderophores that inhibit the movement of toxic ions and promote water movement in plant tissues, thereby enhancing plant growth [60]. Some compounds produced by species of this genus are used in human medicine, for the production of biomaterials, or industrially for substances such as detergents or enzymes used in the textile and paper industries, such as alpha-amylase. Species likeB. subtilishave been genetically manipulated to produce substances on a large scale [61].Additionally,B. subtilisplays an important role in various fields, such as food, feed, cosmetics, chemicals, and pharmaceuticals, as a producer of vitamins (B1, B2, B5, B6, B7, and K), hyaluronic acid, and N-acetylglucosamine [61]. Moreover,B. thuringiensisis used for entomological control as it produces exotoxins and endotoxins that are toxic to various orders of insects, mites, and even nematodes [62].6.1. Antimicrobial Substances Produced by Bacillusspp.It has been observed thatBacillusspp. can produce various antimicrobial compounds that vary in their chemical nature, including ribosomal peptides, polyketides, non-ribosomal small peptide molecules, and lipopeptides.Ribosomal peptides (RPs) are molecules derived from short precursor peptides (100 aa) that mature through post-translational modifications [63]. This group is primarily composed of bacteriocins, along with other enzymes exhibiting antagonistic activity by interfering with quorum sensing (QS) and its interruption, quorum quenching (QQ), or by inducing cell lysis. Bacteriocins are heterogeneous antimicrobial peptides of low molecular weight, exhibiting varying levels and spectra of activity, mechanisms of action, and physicochemical properties. They possess antimicrobial activity against the same bacteria that produced them or closely related bacteria and can be synthesized by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [64]. Karpinski classifies bacteriocins produced by Gram-positive bacteria into four groups: class I (lantibiotics) composed of antimicrobial peptides modified post-translationally and containing unusual amino acids; class II heat-stable peptides that do not undergo modifications and lack lanthionine; class III molecules with a molecular weight greater than 30 kDa; and class IV bacteriocins that require lipid or carbohydrate residues in their molecule for full activity [64]. Examples of bacteriocins include subtilisin, a widely studied lantibiotic synthesized byB. subtilis, which forms pores in the cytoplasmic membrane of Gram-positive bacteria, allowing the efflux of ions and metabolites, leading to membrane potential collapse [65,66]. This alkaline protease is synthesized at the end of the exponential phase and the beginning of the stationary growth phase in response to environmental changes such as osmolarity, carbon levels, and nutrient depletion [67]. Lichenin, a class II bacteriocin produced by strain 26L-10/3RA ofB. licheniformis, is hydrophobic and oxygen-sensitive, exhibiting antagonistic activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [68]. Another example is amylocyclin, a class I bacteriocin produced by strain FZB42 ofB. amyloliquefaciens, which shows antagonistic activity against related Gram-positive bacteria [69].Polyketides (PKs) are a highly diverse family of natural products synthesized from acyl-CoA precursors, such as malonate and methylmalonate. PKs produced byBacillusspp. can be either PKs themselves or hybrids of PKs and nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) [70]. Three types of polyketides produced byB. subtilisare recognized, bacillomycin, difficidin, and macrolactin, all of which exhibit antibacterial activity by inhibiting protein synthesis.Lipopeptides are chemical compounds of a lipid chain covalently bonded to a peptide structure, imparting lipophilic and hydrophilic properties. Many of these compounds have demonstrated the ability to inhibit bacteria and fungi. The production of such substances has been documented inBacillusspp. [71]. Recently, [72] isolated theBacillus amyloliquefaciensstrain LPB-18 capable of producing fengycins and their isoforms, showing the effective inhibition ofAspergillus flavusandFusarium oxysporum. Additionally, this strain exhibited characteristics of a potential probiotic due to its tolerance to acidic conditions and bile salts, making it an excellent candidate for biological strains in agricultural products and animal feed.6.2. Lytic Enzymes Produced by Bacillusspp.In human medicine, certain enzymes produced by microorganisms can be used as medication. Regarding the genusBacillus, lipase production has been observed, which can be used to hydrolyze fats in chronic gastrointestinal diseases [73], and amylase, which can be used to hydrolyze starch in pancreatic insufficiencies [74,75].Furthermore,Bacillusspp. produces fibrinolytic enzymes, predominantly proteases of the subtilisin family [76], which are often used for thrombolytic therapy in human medicine. These include subtilisin DFE, a serine protease expressed in strains ofB. subtilisWB600 [77], proteinases QK-1 and QK-2 derived fromB. subtilisQK02 [78], subtilisin-proteinase like fromB. subtilisTP-6, and serine proteinases fromB. pumilus7P, among others. Furthermore, there are strains that produce enzymes with anticoagulant properties, such as the aforementioned subtilisin-proteinase-like and glutamyl endopeptidase fromB. pumilus7P [79]. These enzymes vary in terms of their molecular weight and specific substrate targets, and they can be encapsulated in nanocapsules to achieve greater stability, facilitating easy oral administration [80]. There are also proteinases that act on amyloid plaques (formed by A\u03b2 peptides of 42 amino acid residues) as those produced in Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Such is the case of glutamyl endopeptidase, subtilisin-like proteinase, and metalloproteinase produced byB. pumilus7P, which cleave A\u03b2 peptides resulting in the formation of non-pathogenic peptides that lack the ability to form plaques [79], and nattokinase (or subtilin NAT) fromB. subtilisnatto [81]. The formation of amyloid can also be observed in diseases caused by prions. Enzymes such as keratinase from different strains ofB. licheniformishave been observed to degrade the protein produced in bovine spongiform encephalopathy (PrPsc) [82,83].Like other bacterial genera, such asPseudomonas,Acinetobacter, andSerratia, certain species within the genusBacillusalso produce enzymes with anti-biofilm activity. Biofilm is defined as a bacterial community embedded in an exopolysaccharide matrix adhered to an inert or living surface. Such is the case withB. licheniformis,where the production of protease B [84], alkalase, which is a serine endopeptidase [85], and the endonucleaseNucB [55,86] has been observed. For its part,B. amyloliquefaciensproduces neutrase, a protease with activity under neutral conditions [87], and theB. pumilusstrain 3\u201319 produces subtilisin-like protease and glutamyl endopeptidase, which degrade the biofilm ofSerratia marcescens[88].Similar to other biocontrol organisms,Bacillusspp. have been observed to produce lytic enzymes. For example, the BT42 strain produces beta-1,3-glucanases that degrade the cell walls of fungi such asColletotrichum gloeosporoidesandFusarium oxysporum, potentially causing cell lysis of these microorganisms [89]. Additionally, species of this genus can produce enzymes involved in quorum quenching (QQ) [59].Similarly, enzymes produced byBacillusspp. can be used as additives incorporated into animal feed. Commercial formulations have been developed that include phytases, proteases, \u03b1-galactosidase, xylanases, and \u03b1-amylase, and are used in swine and poultry production [90]. Species such asB. amyloliquefaciens,B. licheniformis, andB. subtilishave been identified as sources of amylases and proteases [91].6.3. Volatile Compounds Produced by Bacillusspp.Volatile compounds are metabolites that play an important role in microorganisms associated with plants and soil [92]. These compounds disperse easily, performing essential biological and ecological roles in habitats. Volatile compounds can be involved in bioconversion reactions, biogeochemical cycles of essential elements (carbon, nitrogen, phosphate, and sulfur), and many metabolic and physiological reactions, such as nitrification and nitrogen mineralization. Additionally, they can serve as communication signals (QS/QQ) or defense mechanisms [93]. The volatile compounds produced byBacillusspp. can be both organic and inorganic.7. Inorganic Volatile CompoundsThe inorganic volatile compounds of microorganisms are primarily by-products of primary metabolism and can be carbonaceous or hydrogenated compounds containing sulfur or nitrogen, such as HCN, H2S, N2, NH3, and NO. It has been observed thatB. licheniformisis a denitrifying bacterium that generates N2, which is subsequently utilized by nitrogen-fixing bacteria [93].8. Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)VOCs are molecules with fewer than 20 carbon atoms, low molecular weight (100 to 500 Da), high vapor pressure, low boiling point, and lipophilic character [93], mostly derived from the oxidation of glucose [94]. Due to their low molecular weight, VOCs can diffuse over long distances through soil and atmosphere [95]. Depending on their chemical structure, organic compounds can be classified into fatty acid derivatives (hydrocarbons, ketones, and alcohols), acids, compounds containing sulfur, compounds containing nitrogen, and terpenes [96]. These compounds have garnered interest due to their antibiotic properties or their ability to enhance plant defenses, such as 2,3-butanediol and acetoin [97]. The production and diffusion of VOCs by soil microorganisms depend on factors such as available nutrients, oxygen levels, temperature, pH, physiological state of the microorganisms, moisture, soil texture, and architecture [93]. Additionally, the reduction in pathogen growth by VOCs might not only be due to toxicity, but also to the alteration in the pathogen transcriptome [95]. The production of a wide spectrum of volatile compounds with antifungal activity has been observed in strains ofB. amyloliquefaciens,B. subtilis, andB. pumilus[25,98], as well as in strains ofB. amyloliquefaciens,B. pumilus, andB. cereuswith varying degrees of antibacterial activity [99].9. Background on the Use ofBacillusspp. as a ProbioticThe definition of a probiotic was revised in 2014 by the Scientific Association for Probiotics and Prebiotics, which established different categories for live microorganisms used in humans [100]. In this context, live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate doses, confer beneficial effects on the health of the consumer were categorized into categories: (i) probiotics present in foods or supplements not used for a specific purpose (referring to strains that belong to a species safe for administration and with sufficient evidence of health benefits for the consumer), (ii) probiotics in foods or supplements with a specific health effect on the consumer, and (iii) probiotics as drugs or biotherapeutic agents, which have a specific effect and are therefore used for the treatment or prevention of diseases and are regulated as medicines [101].There are several reasons whyBacillusspp. has been evaluated as a probiotic. First, some species of theBacillusgenus and several products produced by species of this genus are recognized as GRAS (Generally Recognized As Safe) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA, Silver Spring, MD, USA). This acronym refers to any substance intentionally added to food as an additive and subject to prior review and approval by the FDA unless the substance is generally recognized, among qualified experts, as having been adequately shown to be safe under the intended conditions of use or is exempt from the definition of a food additive (FDA, USA). To date, strains of different species have GRAS status, such asB. subtilis,B. coagulans,Bacillus clausii,and metabolites/enzymes produced byB. deramificans,B. licheniformis,B. acidopullulyticus, B. amyloliquefaciens,B. thuringiensis,B. circulans,B. subtilis, andB. naganoensis[102].Bacillusspp. can be manufactured in spore form, which can survive extreme environmental conditions. This ensures the stability of the product during storage at temperatures above room temperature. Additionally, the spores\u2019 resistance to high temperatures enables them to be directly mixed into animal feed, which is pelletized at 80 to 85 \u00b0C, and are also capable of surviving stabilization methods used in the production of powdered products, such as freeze-drying or drying, which involve cellular dehydration [39,103]. Spores quickly reach the intestine and secret proteases, lipases, and amylases in the upper intestinal tract after reactivation, which are useful for degrading complex carbohydrates. Previous studies have shown that once ingested, the spores ofBacillusspp. can germinate and exert their action in the intestine [104,105,106].Furthermore, it has been observed thatB. subtiliscan complete an intestinal life cycle in such a way that its spores, after germinating in the intestine, can grow, increase, and re-sporulate, potentially being mobilized by peristaltic movements and released into the environment with fecal matter. This situation could occur in other species of theBacillusgenus [107,108]. Additionally,Bacillusspp. can colonize the intestinal tract of mammals [109,110]. The colonization after the germination process has been evaluated in mice, showing thatBacillusspp. spores germinate in the jejunum and ileum and colonize the intestine temporarily [111]. Another noteworthy characteristic is its ability to form a biofilm [112,113].Different species ofBacillusgenus are used as probiotics in human medicine, administered orally, for the prevention and control of gastrointestinal diseases [114,115]. Recently, Tran et al. examined the efficacy of a nasal spray probiotic composed ofB. subtilisandB. clausiispores to support the treatment of influenza viral infections in pediatric patients, achieving promising results [116].Additionally, manyBacillusstrains are used as a probiotic in different animals, such as pigs, broiler chickens, calves, and in aquaculture [117,118,119,120,121].B. subtilisis a microorganism that has been incorporated as an additive to the feed of various animal species to improve their intestinal function, and it has also been observed to have an antagonistic effect on intestinal pathogens [61].Strains from this genus as potential probiotic are under constant study. Recently, Golnari et al. isolatedBacillusspp. strains from various sources, including soil, faeces, and artisanal dairy products [122]. They systematically investigated their probiotic properties and compared them with those of some established commercialBacillusprobiotics. They obtained eight isolates, which includedB. subtilis,B. amyloliquefaciens,B. coagulans,B. endophyticus,B. pumilus,B. licheniformis, andB. siamensis. All these strains met the tested probiotic criteria. In this regard, Xiao et al. studied the fermentation carried out by theB. subtilisLK-1 strain in Fu brick tea, identifying a total of 45 VOCs, mainly composed of ketones, hydrocarbons, aldehydes, and alcohols, which enhanced the aroma of the final product [123]. Keong et al. also evaluated various strains ofB. subtilisand found thatB. subtilisR0179 performed better in fermenting okara compared toB. subtilisCU1,B. coagulansIS-2, andB. coagulans123, improving both its nutritional value and flavor [124]. Additionally, Bai et al. studied the fermentative capacity ofB. velezensisCS1.10S and conducted a comparative study of soy sauce fermentation. They observed that, in the presence of this strain, there was an increase in amino acid nitrogen content, reducing sugars, and volatile flavor compounds, while the total acidity did not change significantly [125].In conclusion, theBacillusgenus is undergoing continuous revision and expansion, with the incorporation of new species and the reclassification of some of its varieties into new genera. Although identifying these microorganisms presents challenges, significant improvements are being made through the development of advanced methodologies and the application of integrated identification strategies. This genus offers a multitude of benefits that make it indispensable in various fields. Its ability to produce spores resistant to heat, UV radiation, and desiccation enables it to survive in adverse environmental conditions, ensuring its persistence and effectiveness as a biofertilizer and biological control agent. Additionally,Bacillusspp. generate a wide variety of secondary metabolites with antimicrobial properties, volatile compounds, and enzymes, which are highly valuable in the pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries. Its application as a probiotic in animal and human nutrition not only enhances digestive health, but also strengthens the immune system, and its use via aerogenic routes has been considered for the treatment of respiratory system diseases. Furthermore, due to its fermentative capacity, its relevance in the food industry is significant. These advantages establishBacillusspp. as a multifaceted and essential microorganism in modern biotechnology, providing sustainable and efficient solutions for agriculture, medicine, and industry.The high capacity of theBacillusgenus to produce metabolites has been key in the decision and search for strategies to identify species. Since the identification of the first species in 1835, the genus has undergone numerous changes. Various classifications have been proposed, including their grouping into five clusters in 1991, the characterization of 280 species in 2018, and the proposals of two clades and seven genomospecies in 2020. Currently, the genus is composed of 435 species and 12 subspecies grouped into two clades with no phylogenetic relationship between them, whose members produce various metabolites for medical and industrial use.Bacillusis a diverse set of species that is easy to culture, with notable advantages for its conservation and distribution, and a broad productive capacity that makes it a biological factory with unlimited potential.Author ContributionsConceptualization: X.B.C. and A.B.; Writing\u2014Review: X.B.C.; Writing\u2014Review and Editing: X.B.C., C.C., A.B., M.P.B. and M.S.S.

        "title": "Harnessing the Power of Zinc-Solubilizing Bacteria: A Catalyst for a Sustainable Agrosystem",
        "abstract": "A variety of agrochemicals, especially fertilizers, are applied indiscriminately by farmers across trapezoidal landscapes to increase productivity and satisfy the rising food demand. Around one-third of the populace in developing nations is susceptible to zinc (Zn) deficiency as a result of their direct reliance on cereals as a source of calories. Zinc, an essential micronutrient for plants, performs several critical functions throughout the life cycle of a plant. Zinc is frequently disregarded, due to its indirect contribution to the enhancement of yield. Soil Zn deficiency is one of the most prevalent micronutrient deficiencies that reduces crop yield. A deficiency of Zn in both plants and soils results from the presence of Zn in fixed forms that are inaccessible to plants, which characterizes the majority of agricultural soils. As a result, alternative and environmentally sustainable methods are required to satisfy the demand for food. It appears that the application of zinc-solubilizing bacteria (ZSB) for sustainable agriculture is feasible. Inoculating plants with ZSB is likely a more efficacious strategy for augmenting Zn translocation in diverse edible plant components. ZSB possessing plant growth-promoting characteristics can serve as bio-elicitors to promote sustainable plant growth, through various methods that are vital to the health and productivity of plants. This review provides an analysis of the efficacy of ZSB, the functional characteristics of ZSB-mediated Zn localization, the mechanism underlying Zn solubilization, and the implementation of ZSB to increase crop yield.",

        "content": "1. IntroductionThe majority of soils around the world are lacking in plant nutrients, especially micronutrients, and this deficiency leads to the low productivity of agricultural products. Insufficient nutrition and hunger are the two most serious threats to millions of people in poor countries. The use of important nutrients in soil is regarded as an integral component of agriculture in advanced nations. The nutrition of plants is a crucial aspect of improving general cultivation, including the standard of plant products [1]. Micronutrients such as manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), iron (Fe), boron (B), chloride (Cl), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) are essential for livestock, plants, human growth, and development. However, shortages of these nutrients have been recorded in different parts of the world, including Australia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, China, Brazil, Turkey, Africa, Iran, the United States, Iraq, and India, ultimately impacting the soil system and, hence, crop productivity [2].One of the important elements for optimal plant growth is Zn. Zinc plays an important role in various growth and metabolic aspects, including photosynthesis, sugar synthesis, protein synthesis, fertilization and seed formation, growth regulation, disease resistance, etc. All these processes are hampered by Zn deficiency, which ultimately reduces the productivity potential of crop plants [3]. Both humans and animals need a significant amount of Zn; thus, there is a great likelihood that human health will be impacted in regions where crops are frequently deficient in Zn. This is proven by the fact that fertility issues have become more prevalent in people of these regions over the past few years, and because the result is much stronger in animals. An absence of pasture, along with poor animal nutrition, affects the regularity, resulting in animal conception irregularities. By examining the quantity of microminerals in feed and fodder samples, numerous studies were carried out to determine the prevalence of micromineral shortages in animals. One element that has been discovered to be severely lacking in several Indian geographic regions is Zn [4]. Although there is more than enough Zn in the soil to support crop growth, plants are not able to uptake it, due to the presence of inaccessible Zn fragments. Numerous factors influence Zn\u2019s availability in the soil, including soil texture, pH, soil phosphorus, and meteorological conditions. Exogenous usage of Zn in the form of fertilizers is also unorthodox, due to its quick transformation into inaccessible components and buildup in the soil [5]. Therefore, there is a dire need for some exogenous strategies that can increase the availability and accessibility of Zn to the plants for their optimal growth and development.Recently, various techniques have been used to reduce Zn deficiency in host plants. Among these, the application of chemical fertilizers is a costly and unsustainable approach, making crops susceptible to illnesses and, over time, reducing the soil\u2019s fertility. Moreover, indiscriminate fertilizer use has polluted the soil and water, endangering both human health and plant life. Therefore, the interest of researchers is focused on the use of eco-friendly and economic tools which can improve the availability of nutrients (especially Zn) without harming the environment. The use of Zn-solubilizing bacteria (ZSB) is a low-cost alternative technique for Zn biofortification, providing the optimal sustainable approach to environmentally friendly farming. Because microorganisms must exist for Zn solubilization, enhancing the capacity of microbes to solubilize many different insoluble Zn components can be efficiently used to boost the bioavailability of Zn in crops [2]. ZSB found in the rhizospheric hub, as well as in interior plant tissues, demonstrate their ability to solubilize Zn in many different kinds of ways [6]. ZSB-mediated plant growth is generally a consequence of possibly \u201cdirect\u201d or \u201cindirect\u201d plant growth-related strategies. ZSB may affect the plant hormone concentration in plants, as well as improve the acquisition of crucial micronutrients via the accumulation of organic acids and enzymes through direct processes. The uptake of nutrients aided by ZSB may frequently include Zn, Fe, P, N, and K. The indirect mechanism characteristic includes the generation of secondary metabolites, specifically antifungal metabolites, followed by antibacterial chemicals, which might mitigate plant damage caused by phytopathogens (such as soil fungi and bacteria) [7]. Additionally, ZSB have the ability to modulate soil properties, which further enhance the availability of Zn to the plants [8].Keeping in view the above facts, the current review focuses on the magnitude of Zn deficiency, as well as its availability in the soil and its impact on growth and productivity of plants. Moreover, the study discussed the underlying mechanism of Zn solubilization by ZSB, which could be a sustainable approach to improve the bioeconomy of food crops by increasing their quality and productivity.2. Zinc Bioavailability in SoilThe concentration of Zn in the soil majorly depends on the physicochemical properties of the soil. The major edaphic factors affecting the availability of Zn include pH and redox conditions, content of organic matter, total Zn concentration, and microbial activities in the soil. The activity of Zn is the soil has a direct relationship with increasing proton activity; therefore, the solubility of Zn will always be inversely proportional to the soil pH [9]. For example, the solubility and mobility of Zn were reported to be higher in acidic soil than in alkaline, indicating that the pH of the soil is an important factor for Zn availability [10]. Similarly, soil amended with organic matter displayed higher mobility of metals, including Zn, further revealing the impact of soil properties of Zn availability [11]. The amount of Zn present in the soil can be determined through the geochemical composition, as well as the deterioration, of the primary rock (Table 1). The production and consumption of Zn-rich goods, as well as contamination from the environment, may alter the composition of the parent rock. The Zn content of the Earth\u2019s crust is 78 mg/kg, varying among the parent rocks. Zn concentration, for instance, ranges from 40 to 120 mg/kg in magmatic rocks, 10 to 25 mg/kg in dolomites, 15 to 30 mg/kg in sandstones, and 80 to 120 mg/kg in sedimentary rocks and limestones [12].3. Effectiveness of Zn Fertilizers in SoilUnderstanding the cause of Zn scarcity can help in planning appropriate actions to increase soil fertility and crop productivity. The use of various fertilizers, the selection of which is determined by their cost, simplicity, economic compatibility, administration method, and environmental acceptability, is now the most prevalent option used to address Zn shortages. Zn fertilizers are often divided into three categories, namely inorganic, natural organic, and synthetic chelate complexes [4]. ZnO, ZnCO3, ZnSO4, Zn3(PO4)2, and ZnCl2are examples of inorganic Zn sources. The most efficient, readily available, and least expensive fertilizer applied through soil or foliar is Zn sulfate heptahydrate (ZnSO4\u00b77H2O) [2]. Organic Zn fertilizers are composed of a range of ingredients, the most common of which are Zn phenolate, Zn-EDTA, and Zn lignosulfonate. Fertilizers such as zincated urea, zincated super, and boronated super have demonstrated long-term effectiveness in increasing soil fertility and lowering plant micronutrient deficiency, when paired with micronutrients. Farmers use organic fertilizers less frequently, due to their inefficiency and budgetary issues [13]. To overcome these challenges, scientists are working toward advancing the development of biofertilizers that could increase the soil\u2019s soluble Zn concentration without harming the environment [4].4. Physiological Functions of Zn in PlantsZinc needs to be present in minute but important amounts for numerous essential plant physiological pathways to function properly. Zinc is a structural constituent or regulatory cofactor of many different enzymes and proteins involved in various metabolic pathways in plants; for instance, in photosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism, protein as well as auxin metabolism, the maintenance of membrane integrity, pollen formation, and resistance to pathogen attack [12,14,15]. Because Zn is required for the activity of a wide range of enzymes, Zn shortages therefore impair protein, carbohydrate, and auxin metabolism, as well as reproductive activities [12,14]. Zinc plays a vital role in maintaining cellular membrane integrity, by modulating the detoxification of reactive oxygen species [16]. Moreover, Zn-deficient plants are more susceptible to root infections likeFusarium graminearum, due to greater leakage of carbon-containing chemicals into the rhizosphere [12]. Zinc also safeguards plants against oxidative stress by increasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD (superoxide dismutase), POD (peroxidase), CAT (catalase), APX (ascorbate peroxidase), and GR (glutathione reductase) [17]. Furthermore, Zn aids in pollination by influencing the pollen tube development [12]. Zn is also required for the maintenance of living membranes and is also linked to membrane phospholipids as well as sulfhydryl component groups [15]. It can also form tetragonal compounds with cysteine polypeptide chain residues, protecting proteins and lipids from oxidative damage [18]. Zn deficiency in plants is associated with the disruption of normal enzyme action, which, for instance, inhibits photosynthesis, as Zn is a cofactor of carbonic anhydrase, boosting the fixation of CO2in the chloroplast and consequently the Rubisco enzyme\u2019s carboxylation capabilities [18]. Furthermore, a deficiency of Zn ions produces a variety of irregularities in the development of plants, e.g., dwarfism, chlorosis, and, more specifically, spikelet sterility [15]. Additionally, Zn deficiency has an adverse effect on the quality of harvested crop products, infection induced by pathogen attacks, and plant susceptibility to various abiotic stresses [12].5. Zinc-Solubilizing Bacteria (ZSB) as a BiofertilizerBiofertilizer is defined as a substance containing microorganisms that are living and, when applied to seed, plant surfaces, or soil, colonize the rhizosphere or the plant and facilitate development through boosting the intake, along with the accessibility, of essential nutrients for the host plant [19,20]. Microbial inoculants have various advantages over chemical alternatives. They are environmentally friendly and sustainable sources of renewable nutrients necessary for soil health and life [21,22]. They also have negative effects on various agricultural diseases that help the plants to resist unfavorable circumstances [19]. In accordance with the ability, they have to acquire nutrients from the soil, fix atmospheric nitrogen, drive nutrient solubilization, and function as biocontrol agents [23]; therefore, various microbiological species are being widely exploited to serve as effective natural fertilizers.ZSB can help to overcome Zn shortages by turning insoluble Zn into soluble Zn, improving its availability and the efficiency of its uptake by host plants. The selection and inoculation of ZSB, either in pure form or in combination with inexpensive insoluble Zn substances, would reduce the expense of manufacturing the agricultural product [1]. A number of microbes have also been shown to serve an important role with regard to the solubilization of potassium (K), phosphorus (P), iron (Fe), silicates, and Zn in plant roots. Khan et al. [24] reported that Zn-mobilizing plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) significantly improved total biomass, harvest index, yield, and Zn content in rice grains, and reduced the symptoms of Zn deficiency. Rehman et al. [25] reported a higher efficacy of ZSB, i.e.,Pseudomonassp., in improving the productivity of wheat plants. Abaid-Ullah et al. [26] qualitatively and quantitatively selected 9 out of 50 ZSB on a variety of insoluble Zn ores, including Zn(CO3)2, ZnO, Zn(PO4)3, and ZnS, and recorded the higher bioavailability of Zn in ZSB-inoculated ores. Among the ZSB,Serratia liquefaciens,S. marcescens, andB. thuringiensisFA-2, FA-3, and FA-4 strains outperformed and improved the Zn uptake in grains by 68%, 57% and 46%, respectively. When PGPR strains are inoculated into various plant species, they have been demonstrated to boost the availability and uptake of Zn [19]. In a nutshell, ZSB can increase the bioavailability of Zn to crops by making it soluble, from both organic and inorganic pools of total soil Zn.6. Roles of ZSB in the Biofortification of Crop Plants6.1. Mechanism of ActionInsoluble zincate formation as a result of Zn fertilizer applications is a severe threat to the plant\u2013soil system. Zinc-solubilizing bacteria can be employed as an alternative to Zn supplements, as they can convert insoluble forms of Zn into soluble forms. Moreover, they can improve plant growth and development by breaking down complex Zn molecules into simpler forms, thereby boosting the quantity of Zn accessible to the plants. The capacity of PGPR to dissolve metal salts is critical, because it allows plants to use the mobilized forms. PGPR uses a range of mechanisms to solubilize nutrients in soil; for example, acidification through the production of organic acids, exchange reactions, the manufacturing of metal chelating molecules known as \u201csiderophores\u201d or \u201cchelated ligands\u201d, and the involvement of an oxidation\u2013reduction system [4,27] and gluconate or gluconic acid derivatives that consist of 2-keto-gluconic acid and 5-keto-gluconic acid [2], as well as many other organic acids produced by PGPR, are likely the mechanisms by which Fe and Zn are mobilized [28]. Acidification is the most prevalent method that ZSB choose to improve the solubilization and bioavailability of Zn. Sindhu et al. [6] observed that biofertilizer varieties featuringPseudomonassp.,Agrobacteriumsp., andAzospirillum lipoferumreleased insoluble Zn as a result of the production of the chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, thereby making the Zn accessible to rice. Moreover, ZSB also produce organic acids in the soil, which act as a reservoir for Zn cations, leading to the lowering of the soil pH around them [29]. The synthesis of gluconate, or derivatives of gluconic acid, such as 2-keto-gluconic acid, 5-keto-gluconic acid, and many other organic acids, by ZSB are likely key components in the procedure of Fe and Zn absorption [4]. Yadav et al. [30] reported that the transformation of insoluble forms of Zn compounds to soluble forms is achieved byBacillusspecies through the secretion of organic acids, proton extrusion, and the synthesis of chelating ligands; also, ZSB produces gluconic acid and 2-ketogluconic acid, which are the primary acids that regulate Zn solubilization.6.2. Chelation of Zn by SiderophoreZn-chelating substances raise Zn\u2019s bioavailability in the root rhizosphere and are released by the roots of plants and ZSB. The ZSB release a variety of compounds that bind to Zn2+to lessen their interaction within the soil [5]. Siderophores are potent soluble Zn-binding chelating agents. These substances are tiny, high-affinity molecules that are released by bacteria, fungi, and plants. Because of low Zn solubility at high pH levels, these substances are formed by a variety of bacteria, including those that respond to Zn deficiency, which often occurs in neutral to alkaline pH soils. Kumar et al. [31] have identified siderophore-producing microorganisms from the rhizosphere that are members of the following genera:Bradyrhizobium,B. megaterium,P. aeruginosa,Pseudomonas,Serratia, andStreptomyces. Verma et al. [32] identifiedBacillus altitudinisC7 andPseudonocardia alniM29 as major siderophore producers, which exhibited the potential ability to solubilize Zn. Similarly, Bhatt and Maheshwari [33] reported thatBacillus megaterium, a ZSB, was able to enhance plant growth through siderophore production. Similarly,Serratiasp. andAcinetobactersp. were also observed to be siderophore-producing ZSB by Othman et al. [34].6.3. Molecular Mechanism of Zn Uptake and Translocation in PlantsGenomes of plants are made from a vast array of genes which exhibit accurate sequences of expression, in accordance with the absorption and transportation of Zn. This mechanism guarantees that all tissues, particularly the edible portions, acquire an adequate quantity of essential nutrients needed to maintain the essential functions of the cell. Certain genes, particularly those belonging to theZIPfamily, were recently identified in plants and are essential for the transportation and build-up of Zn [35]. Elevated or decreased Zn concentrations affect the way these particular genes show themselves. Various plants were discovered to have upregulated expressions ofZIPfamily genes during a Zn shortage [6]. Ajeesh Krishna et al. [36] reported 16ZIPtransporters in different plant parts of rice, comprehending the mechanics of Zn transport. A significant influx transporter was found in the plasma membrane of rice,ZIP-OsZIP9, demonstrating its role in Zn uptake [37]. Deshpande et al. [38] reported that theTaZIPfamily of genes are essential for the uptake and movement of Zn in different parts of wheat. Similarly, the expression ofTaZIPtransporters, includingTaZIP3,TaZIP5,TaZIP6,TaZIP7, andTaZIP13, were elevated in the shoot and root of wheat during Zn deficiency [39].The details of ZSB\u2019s role in improving the growth and productivity of host plants are listed inTable 2.6.4. Zn-Assisted BiofortificationThe role of ZSB in the amendment of synthetic Zn fertilizers in the soil and their transformation into an inaccessible substance, known as a Zn compound, exacerbates the problem of Zn immobility from soil to plant system, and this issue is capable of being solved by using ZSB inoculants [6]. The use of ZSB as a bioinoculant is an affordable way of biofortifying food crops with Zn. Moreover, the utilization of ZSB, which has several plant growth-promoting qualities, represents an innovative approach towards generating sustainable bio-fortified crops [6]. ZSB, living in the rhizosphere, colonized the host plants effectively, allowing their functioning as a supplementary partner of the plant root, for the improved absorption of nutrients, by solubilizing the complex or unavailable form of Zn in soils [64]. Rhizobacteria are widely recognized microorganisms that live and colonize in the rhizosphere and exhibit a variety of plant-growth-related characteristics, including phosphate and potassium solubilization, exopolysaccharide and siderophore production, phytohormones synthesis (gibberellins, auxin cytokinins, etc.), and HCN production [65]. According to previous research, various strains of ZSB have been reported to play vital roles in Zn biofortification of some food crops. For instance,Burkholderia cepaciaimproved growth, grain yield, dry weight, and Zn acquisition in rice [66],Bacillus altitudinisin chickpea [48,67],B. tequilensisin wheat [62,68], andPseudomonasspp. in tomato [69]. Similarly,B. aryabhattai, as well asB. subtilis, enhanced cob dry weight, cob length, and grain yield in maize plants [70],R. tropiciandB. subtilisimproved dry matter and grain yield in common bean [71], andPseudomonas plecoglossicida, as well asBrevibacterium antiqunum, increased plant height, dry biomass, and productivity of pigeon pea [67]. Moreover, Zn-solubilizing endophytes acted as biofortifying agents, to improve Zn localization in the eatable part of rice as well as chickpeas [57] and wheat [25]. Some ZSB, such asBacillussp. [72],Pantoea dispersa,Pseudomonas fragi,Enterobacter cloacae,Pantoea agglomerans,Rhizobiumsp.,Acinetobacter, andBurkholderiahave all been employed effectively as bio-inoculants for bacteria-assisted biofortification [6,73].6.5. ZSB as a Stress AlleviatorExtrinsic factors that have an adverse effect on growth and development of plants are commonly referred as \u201cstresses\u201d [74,75]. Signals from stress, including drought, heat, salinity, herbivory, and pathogens, are known to be perceived and responded by all plants [76,77,78]. Plant existence against diverse abiotic and biotic challenges is based on their timely preparedness in modifying their inherent tolerance mechanisms to mitigate the effects of environmental stresses [79,80,81]. However, under severe stressed conditions, plants are not able to overcome these unfavourable circumstances; therefore, exogenous stress-alleviative and eco-friendly strategies are required (Figure 1). Because of the varied roles of PGPR, including ZSB, they are widely used to decrease abiotic stresses produced by climate change [82]. ZSB has the ability to make plants resistant to certain abiotic stressors; therefore, improving the density of ZSB in the plant rhizosphere could be an effective alternative approach to increase the growth and productivity of host plants [24]. Barnwal et al. [83] reported thatArthrobacter protophormiae, as well asDietzia natronolimnaea, improved salt tolerance, whereasBacillus subtilisincreased the drought resilience in wheat plants by modifying the levels of phytohormone. Jha and Subramanian, in [84], when investigating rice plants treated withPseudomonas pseudoalcaligenesandBacillus pumilus, recorded a higher expression of stress-related genes and an increased level of osmoprotectants under salinity-stressed conditions. Potato plants inoculated withMethylobacteriumsp. displayed an increased number of lateral roots and leaves, a higher rosette diameter and improved tolerance against salinity and different fungal pathogens [85]. The activity of different antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and peroxidase) was upregulated in ZSB-inoculated wheat plants and, thereby, displayed better resistance to salt stress.Pseudomonas fluorescens- andP. poae-boosted growth of petunia plants under drought and low-nutrient environments [86].Pseudomonas fluorescensandBacillus subtilisnegated the effects of salinity by enhancing the accumulation of proline (an active osmolyte) [87]. On the same line, Orozco-Mosqueda et al. [88] revealed thatPseudomonassp. protected tomato plants against salt stress. El-Esawi et al. [89] reported thatAzospirillum lipoferumreduced the negative effects of salt stress by modulating osmolytes synthesis, antioxidant enzymes, and the expression of stress-related genes in chickpea.Besides abiotic factors, plants are exposed to a wide range of biotic agents, including microorganisms such as viruses, viroids, bacteria, fungus, nematodes, etc., which can cause biotic stress and ultimately, reduce agricultural productivity (Figure 1). ZSB exhibit diverse direct and indirect mechanisms to suppress the diseases caused by various pathogens, such as the synthesis of secondary metabolites, antioxidants, hormones, cell wall-degrading enzymes, etc. [76,90]. Many ZSB produce antagonistic low-molecular-weight chemical molecules known as antibiotics, which are highly effective in inhibiting phytopathogen growth. For example,Bacillussp. have the ability to produce antibiotics like polymyxin, circulin, and colistin [76]. Ali et al. [91] reported thatB. subtilissynthesized surfactins, fengycin, and iturin, whereasPseudomonas aeruginosa,P. stutzeri,P. fluorescens, andP. putidaproduced phenazine, rhamnolipids, pyochelin, violacein, and pyoverdines, which were efficient against different fungal phytopathogens. Research conducted by Fernandez et al. [92] showed thatPseudomonas fluorescensproduced two different kinds of S-type bacteriocins, i.e., colicin and tailocins, which are phage-tail-like bacteriocins. The synthesis of lytic enzymes, like protease, chitinase, cellulase, b-1,3-glucanase, etc., is linked to the fact that some ZSB have inhibitory effects, in opposition to phytopathogens [93]. Several studies have proven that rhizospheric bacteria produce lytic enzymes that break down the cell wall of plant root pathogens, for instanceRhizoctonia solaniandFusarium oxysporum, thereby leading to cell death [91]. Cheng et al. [94] reported the inhibitory properties ofBacillus megaterium,B. cereus, andBacillussp. against maize rot pathogen. Non-pathogenic PGPR organisms found in soil not only stimulate plant development but can also cause systemic resistance, known as induced systemic resistance (ISR). Many plants develop systemic resistance (both SAR\u2014systemic acquired resistance\u2014and ISR) to various biotic stresses as a result of PGPR, which defends against pathogen attacks [95].Pseudomonas putidaandBacillus subtilisPGPR strains imparted systemic resistance inVigna radiatagrown under disease-prone environments [96].Bacillus amyloliquefaciensimproved tomato plants\u2019 susceptibility to yellow leaf curl virus disease by upregulating the expression of pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and improving the activity of b-1,3 glucanase, phenylalanine ammonia lyase, peroxidase, and polyphenol oxidase, as well as chitinase in the leaves [97]. In a nutshell, soil rhizobacteria have the potential to mitigate the impact of various environmental constraints (abiotic and biotic) in a sustainable manner (Table 3).7. Conclusions and Future AspectsCurrent agricultural practices heavily depend on chemical fertilizers to boost crop output, prioritizing macronutrients and neglecting micronutrients like Zn. This imbalance leads to Zn deficiencies in plants, ultimately affecting their growth and productivity. Efforts to address this issue through fortification and supplementation are expensive and labor-intensive, thereby limiting their success. A promising alternative to overcome this problem is the use of ZSB, in order to reduce the use of commercial fertilizers. The present review discusses the role of ZSB in improving Zn bioavailability in soil and its uptake by plants. ZSB supplementation enhances growth, as well as yield, and biofortifies the crops with Zn in an effective, economical, and eco-friendly manner. ZSB not only addresses Zn deficiencies but also improves the uptake of other essential nutrients like phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium, and iron under adverse environmental circumstances. Moreover, ZSB regulates plant pathogenic microorganisms, contributing to overall soil health and fertility. Concisely, the inoculation of ZSB can be used as an environment-friendly approach for improving plant development and soil health in sustainable agriculture. However, more research work is required for the isolation and identification of suitable ZSB species that can provide maximum benefit to the host by improving the grain Zn content, thereby fighting against hidden hunger.Author ContributionsS.S. wrote the first draft of this manuscript.

        "content": "1. IntroductionAntibiotics have been the mainstay of therapy for treating microbial infections since the discovery of penicillin by Alexander Fleming in 1929 [1]. Shortly after the first antibiotics were discovered and introduced to the market, antimicrobial resistance started to develop. The mechanisms of antibiotic resistance are shown inFigure 1[2]. For several decades, the issue of antibiotic resistance was alleviated by the introduction of new classes of antibiotics. However, the development of novel antibiotics has slowed down significantly in recent years, and as a result, antimicrobial resistance has increased exponentially [3]. Furthermore, the misuse and excessive dispensing of antibiotics in various health and agricultural sectors has exacerbated the issue and led to the development of resistant strains [4]. Bacteria undergo genetic mutations to avoid lethal damage when exposed to a threat, showcasing genetic plasticity through both genome rearrangements and the acquisition of exogenous genes via horizontal gene transfer. This adaptability plays a crucial role in antimicrobial resistance [5]. Bacteria will continue to evolve and develop resistance strategies as long as antibiotics are employed, as it is an inevitable outcome of evolution [6].In 2017, with the escalation of antibiotic resistance globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) published a list of bacterial pathogens that are resistant to numerous conventional antibiotics. The bacteria listed with the highest priority status includedEnterococcus faecium,Staphylococcus aureus,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Acinetobacter baumannii,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, andEnterobacter speciesand are often referred to by the acronym ESKAPE [7,8]. The matter of antibiotic resistance is especially concerning in hospital settings because nosocomial infections involve bacteria that exhibit multidrug resistance (MDR), which refers to the ability of microorganisms to withstand the effects of at least three classes of antibiotics that are intended to kill or inhibit their growth [5]. A recent study involving more than 1 million hospitalized patients in the United States revealed that ESKAPE pathogens constituted 42.2% of the species isolated from bloodstream infections. The results demonstrated that patients infected with ESKAPE pathogens experienced a 3.3-day increase in the length of stay and a 2.1% increase in mortality rates compared to those infected by non-ESKAPE pathogens [9]. These virulent ESKAPE pathogens encompass multidrug-resistant properties. Despite their genetic diversity, these bacteria share resistance mechanisms that contribute to the survival of these pathogens. Understanding the mechanisms underlying bacterial resistance is important for limiting the spread of ESKAPE pathogens, mitigating the spread of antimicrobial resistance, and designing novel strategies to overcome resistance patterns [7,8].Bacteria utilize the following two primary classifications of resistance mechanisms to counter antibiotics: intrinsic and acquired resistance [10]. With innate resistance, specific bacterial species exhibit inherent structural characteristics that provide resistance to certain antibiotics. These groups of bacteria typically lack a target site for the specific antibiotic, rendering the drug ineffective. For example,Mycoplasmaspecies do not have a cell wall; thus, they are resistant to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics and glycopeptides, which primarily target bacterial cell walls. On the other hand, acquired resistance is achieved either through genome modifications or through the transfer of genetic material that confers resistance from other bacterial strains through horizontal gene transfer [10,11,12,13]. An example of acquired resistance is seen in the development of the high-level aminoglycoside resistance (HLAR) phenotype. Some species of bacteria can produce aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, including phosphotransferases, acetyltransferases, and nucleotidyltransferases. The enzymes are located on plasmids and are readily spread between bacteria. They alter the conformation of the antibiotic, hindering its ability to bind to its target [14]. Generally, bacterial strains that display innate or acquired resistance diminish the efficacy of a specific antibiotic via one or more of the following strategies: (1) limiting drug uptake by decreasing the permeability of the cell wall, (2) altering the drug target, (3) modifying enzymes to inactivate the drug, and (4) activating the drug efflux pump [11]. Another protective mechanism used by pathogenic bacteria to combat antibiotics involves the formation of biofilms [3,15]. Biofilms surround the bacterial cells with a thick adhesive matrix that contains polysaccharides, proteins, and extracellular DNA of the resident bacteria. The proximity of bacterial cells within a biofilm facilitates horizontal gene transfer, making it easier for the bacteria to share resistance genes. Furthermore, the bacterial cells in biofilms tend to be sessile, and therefore antibiotics that target growing or dividing bacteria are rendered ineffective. Overall, biofilms protect the bacteria from antimicrobial agents and provide protection from the host immune response. The matrix barrier allows resistant microorganisms to grow in the presence of an antibiotic at a concentration that would otherwise be inhibitory to growth [11,12,16]. Pathogenic microorganisms, especially the ESKAPE pathogens, employ all the previously mentioned mechanisms to combat antibiotics. As a result, bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics has decreased, making it extremely challenging for clinicians to treat patients suffering from infections associated with MDR pathogens. The development of innovative antibiotics is extremely challenging due to its time-consuming processes, high costs, and the rapid emergence of resistance upon the introduction of any new antibiotic. Due to these challenges, the current pipeline for developing new antibiotics includes only 27 drug candidates that target the ESKAPE pathogens. Most of these drug candidates are modifications of previous classes that already exhibit cross-resistance [17]. With the rise of antimicrobial resistance and the difficulties associated with antibiotic discovery, the pursuit of alternatives has become an urgent medical need. Current research is focusing on investigating novel alternatives to antibiotics that may involve targeting unique mechanisms of action or will work synergistically with current antibiotics to enhance their effects [18]. Some of the proposed options for antibiotic alternatives include dual antibiotic therapy, drug-adjuvant combinational therapy, antimicrobial peptides, monoclonal antibodies, bacteriophages, probiotics, nanomaterials or nanoparticles, and cannabinoids (Figure 2).2. MethodsA review of previously published studies was conducted. The search terms used included the following: antibiotic efficacy, antimicrobials, probiotics, antimicrobial biologics, biofilms, quorum sensing, drug delivery, etc. MEDLINE, EMBASE, related internet websites, and reference lists were searched with a date range of 2000 to 2023 to identify appropriate papers that addressed the objectives of this review. Publications were reviewed independently by two investigators. The investigators extracted the data and inspected each reference identified by the search and applied inclusion criteria. In cases in which the same studies were reported in more than one publication, the study\u2019s results were accounted for only once. The electronic search was followed by extensive hand searching using reference lists from the identified articles. Publications written in English were reviewed exclusively.3. Alternatives Methods to Antibiotics in the Face of Antibiotic Resistance3.1. Dual Antimicrobial Therapy and Drug\u2013Adjuvant CombinationsTo date, various mechanisms of bacterial resistance have been reported in nearly all antibiotics on the market [19]. The relationship between the duration of antibiotic exposure and the development of antibiotic resistance indicates the importance of using drugs with favorable pharmacokinetic properties that enable rapid access to the intended target site. Unfortunately, many available treatment options do not have these properties and alternative options must be considered. One approach to improve the susceptibility of bacteria to conventional antibiotics is the utilization of combinational therapy, which involves combining two or more antibiotics based on their susceptibility pattern so that the two agents can work synergistically. This approach is favorable because it can provoke an enhanced response [20]. Three potential mechanisms of this approach include the inhibition of a mutual target and different pathways, the inhibition of different targets and the same pathway, and the inhibition of the same target and the same pathway [4]. The first mechanism can be understood by reviewing a four-drug regimen protocol used in the treatment of tuberculosis infections caused byMycobacterium tuberculosis, which is known as RIPE therapy. These drugs each have a unique mechanism of action, as follows: rifampicin inhibits RNA polymerase and prevents replication, isoniazid inhibits InhA, a key component of fatty acid synthesis that is found in the cell wall ofMycobacterium tuberculosis, the mechanism of action of pyrazinamide is not well understood at this time, and ethambutol inhibits arabinosyl transferases, which are key players in synthesis of the bacterial cell wall. The RIPE regimen demonstrates the benefit of utilizing different pathways in combinational therapy; because there are at least three pathways involved in the RIPE regimen, ifM. tuberculosiscan resist one pathway, several other pathways will be restricted [6,21]. An example of a combinational therapy that inhibits two separate targets in the same pathway is Bactrim, which is made up of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. The components of Bactrim each inhibit different steps in folic acid synthesis within the same pathway. They target dihydrofolate reductase and dihydropteroate synthase, respectively. On the other hand, the components of Synercid, quinupristin, and dalfopristin work toward a distinct target and inhibit a single pathway. The components of Synercid bind to adjacent sites on the 50S ribosomal subunit and exhibit bactericidal activity when they work synergistically. Studies have demonstrated that Synercid is 10\u2013100 times more effective than either of its individual components, which emphasizes the benefits of combining antimicrobial agents [21,22].Another method utilized to combat antibiotic resistance involves drug\u2013adjuvant combinations. Adjuvants serve as molecules that enhance the antibacterial activity of an antibiotic by directly targeting resistance mechanisms, indirectly enhancing the antibacterial effects by inhibiting efflux pumps, or disrupting bacterial signaling pathways [20]. A commonly prescribed drug\u2013adjuvant combination is Augmentin, which is composed of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid. Pathogenic bacteria have developed the \u03b2-lactamase enzyme to protect themselves against the \u03b2-lactam antibiotics. As resistance to \u03b2-lactam antibiotics expanded, there was an increased need for alternative therapeutic options. The addition of clavulanic acid, which is a \u03b2-lactamase inhibitor, improves the efficacy of amoxicillin by inhibiting the \u03b2-lactamase enzymes that inactivate amoxicillin. However, it is important to note that not all \u03b2-lactamase enzymes are sensitive to \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors. Therefore, there is increased research toward developing advanced \u03b2-lactamase inhibitors such as BLI-489 and LK-157 molecules, which have demonstrated promising results for the inhibition of the extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase (ESBL) bacteria in preclinical studies [6].Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriadevelop resistance against cephalosporins by encoding AmpC \u03b2-lactamase. Avibactam is useful in this context because it enhances the activity of ceftazidime due to its ability to inhibit the hydrolytic activity of AmpC [6,23,24]. In a study conducted by Levasseur et al., the results indicated that ceftazidime in combination with avibactam was superior to ceftazidime on its own. The susceptibility ofPseudomonas aeruginosato ceftazidime was reported to be 65% when the cephalosporin was used alone. However, when ceftazidime was combined with avibactam, the susceptibility increased to 94%. Overall, the selection of dual antimicrobial therapy and antibiotic\u2013adjuvant combinations allows for therapeutic options with a broad spectrum of activity, as well as improved efficacy against resistant bacterial pathogens. Some drawbacks of this method include the increased risks of systemic side effects and the possibility of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions [25].3.2. Antimicrobial PeptidesIn the face of growing antibiotic resistance, there is increased focus on the potential application of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) for targeting pathogenic bacteria. AMPs are short, positively charged peptides that play a role in the innate immune systems of prokaryotes, insects, plants, and higher animals [18,26]. AMP-based therapies display broad-spectrum antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal activity and are expected to emerge as alternatives to antibiotics. To date, the FDA has granted approval for several AMPs for antibacterial treatment, while additional AMPs are currently undergoing clinical development [27]. The promising potential of AMPs as antibacterial therapeutics is attributed to their broad-spectrum bactericidal activity, coupled with the low risk for the development of resistance against peptides [28]. AMPs exert their antimicrobial effects by targeting the bilayer structures within bacterial cell walls of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. AMPs are positively charged and therefore can interact with the negatively charged polysaccharides in the cell membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, as well as the negatively charged lipoteichoic acid in the membranes of Gram-positive bacteria [18,28]. This mechanism makes AMPs favorable antimicrobials because bacteria rarely develop resistance against this mechanism. In addition, resistance is rare for antimicrobial peptides due to the unique characteristics of these peptides. Each AMP has a distinct structure and peptide-to-lipid ratio and unique lipid membrane properties, which allow for diverse mechanisms of action. Furthermore, with progress in sequencing technologies, these AMPs can be readily modified, thereby allowing them to serve as adjuvants to antibiotics and enhance their effectiveness by overcoming any developing resistance [22]. Several AMPs have been approved by the FDA for clinical use and include gramicidin, polymyxins, daptomycin, vancomycin, oritavancin, dalbavancin, and telavancin. Gramicidin D was approved by the FDA in 1955 as a component of Neosporin for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. Since its approval, gramicidin has most often been utilized to treat nasal, ocular, and throat infections, as well as surface wound infections. Polymyxins are used topically to treat eye infections, for the selective decontamination of the digestive tract (SDD), and for the treatment of infections caused by drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Colistin, a polymyxin, is a cyclic lipopeptide that was approved by the FDA in 1962. Colistin works against numerous Gram-negative bacteria, includingPseudomonas aeruginosa,Klebsiella pneumoniae, andAcinetobacterspecies. Daptomycin, a cyclic AMP, was approved by the FDA in 2003 for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria such asStaphylococcus aureus. Cubicin, which is a derivative of daptomycin, was approved for the treatment of skin and soft tissue infections, as well as bloodstream infections caused byStaphylococcus aureus. Oritavancin, dalbavancin, and telavancin are derived from vancomycin, which was FDA-approved as an oral solution in 1983. These derivatives have greater potency compared to vancomycin, and they are effective against vancomycin-resistant bacteria. Like cubicin, oritavancin, dalbavancin, and telavancin are used to treat skin and soft tissue infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. They received FDA approval in 2014, 2014, and 2009, respectively [22,29].3.3. Monoclonal AntibodiesMonoclonal antibodies (MABs) are produced by B cells and work by selectively targeting antigens. In recent years, MABs have gained appeal as therapeutic options due to their high specificity and favorable side effect profile [30]. They play a crucial role in the treatment of cancers, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory disorders [31]. However, to date, only three monoclonal antibodies have received approval by the FDA for the treatment of bacterial infections. These include bezlotoxumab, raxibacumab, and obiltoxaximab [32]. These MABs exhibit their antimicrobial effects by neutralizing secretory toxins. Bezlotoxumab was approved in 2017, after the completion of two phase 3 clinical trials, for the treatment of recurrentClostridium difficileinfections. Bezlotoxumab works by neutralizing enterotoxin B. The results of clinical studies revealed that in patients infected withClostridium difficile, those who received bezlotoxumab in conjunction with antibiotics experienced a 38% reduction in reinfection rates compared to patients who received only antibiotics. Raxibacumab and obiltoxaximab were approved for the treatment of inhalational anthrax. The safety profiles of both raxibacumab and obiltoxaximab have been investigated in healthy volunteers, but they have not yet been used in clinical practice. In practice, these MABs may be employed as adjuncts to antibiotics or may be used prophylactically, offering protection to high-risk groups [31,33].3.4. BacteriophagesBacteriophages are viral entities that invade bacteria and can be genetically modified for various antibacterial applications. Although their clinical application dates back to the beginning of the 20th century, their popularity declined a few decades later with the rise of antibiotics in the mid-20th century. Today, as antibiotic resistance becomes more prevalent, there is a rising interest in utilizing bacteriophages to treat MDR infections (Figure 3) [34,35]. The mechanistic effects of bacteriophages are unique to other antibacterial agents. The first step in bacteriophage infection is adsorption to receptors on the host\u2019s surface in a lock-and-key interaction. After adsorption, the phage expels its genetic material into the bacterial host cell [35]. Lytic phages undergo replication inside the host bacterial cells and have the capability to produce virolysins, or lytic enzymes, that degrade peptidoglycan in the bacterial cell wall. On the other hand, lysogenic phages can be genetically engineered to express specific proteins, enzymes, antimicrobial peptides, or toxins to disrupt the normal metabolic processes in bacteria [6,18]. Phage therapy is being extensively studied on a global scale for the development of optimized phages or combinations of these phages that can be used in clinical practice. Over the past decade, several in vitro and preclinical studies have been conducted and are now being considered for entry into clinical trials [22]. An interesting approach involves utilizing the endolysins produced by phages to break down bacterial cell walls. A study conducted by Wu et al., demonstrated that the phage PD-6A3, along with its endolysin Ply6A3, improved sepsis in rodents in approximately one-third of cases involving clinical MDR strains ofAcinetobacter baumannii[36]. Ye et al. summarized some endolysins that are currently being studied as alternatives to antibiotics to treat MDR organisms [32]. For example, an endolysin, Ply6A3, demonstrated high antibacterial activity againstEscherichia coli,Acinetobacter baumannii, and methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA). Another endolysin, rSAL-1, has demonstrated activity against MRSA and has been developed and tested as a drug known as SAL200 to treatStaphylococcus aureusinfections. This drug has several favorable properties, including potent bacteriolytic effects against MDR bacterial strains and hard-to-treat biofilms. In addition, it showed no serious adverse effects in phase 1 clinical trials. SAL200 is the first endolysin-based drug to be approved for treating human skin and soft tissue infections caused by methicillin-susceptibleStaphylococcus aureus(MSSA) and methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA). Ye et al. reported that the endolysin, CF-301, has demonstrated activity againstStaphylococcus aureusand has been developed and tested as a drug known as Exebacase, which is used for the treatment ofS. aureusbloodstream infections and is currently in phase 3 clinical studies. During phase 2, it was found that in combination with antibiotics, Exebacase improved clinical outcomes including reductions in mortality, length of hospital stays, and in-hospital readmission rates in hospitalized patients suffering fromS. aureusbloodstream infections and endocarditis [32,37,38].3.5. ProbioticsProbiotics are microorganisms that confer health benefits when administered in adequate quantities [7]. Probiotics most often belong to theBifidobacterium,Lactobacillus,Saccharomyces, orBacillusgenera. These microorganisms provide antibacterial effects via the following mechanisms: the production of antimicrobial bacteriocins, enhancement of mucosal barriers to prevent bacterial attachment and entry into the mammalian gut, elimination of toxins, restoration of gut dysbiosis, and induction of immunomodulation by promoting protective cytokines and suppressing pro-inflammatory cytokines [6,18]. In the past century, many studies have revealed the benefits of utilizing probiotics, ranging from direct inhibition of pathogenic microorganisms to improvements in host immune system functions, thereby influencing the survival of bacterial pathogens. A study conducted by Piewngam et al. indicates the potential for utilizing Bacillus strains as a probiotic therapy to eradicate Staphylococcus aureus. They found that Bacillus subtilis secreted lipopeptides known as fengycins. Fengycins display antibacterial activity through the inhibition of the S. aureus agr quorum-sensing system, which is vital for S. aureus survival [39]. Lee et al. focused on the HW01 bacteriocin, produced by thePediococcus acidilacticiprobiotic, and its activity againstPseudomonas aeruginosa. They found that while HW01 bacteriocin did not affectP. aeruginosain its planktonic state, the bacteriocin was successful in reducing the viability of biofilm cells. HW01 decreased the motility ofP. aeruginosa, reduced the production of virulence factors, and inhibited biofilm formation [40]. In an in vivo study that was conducted, 140 species ofLactobacilluswere tested againstKlebsiella pneumoniae. Thirteen of the tested strains were able to prevent the formation of biofilms. In addition, they found that 1 of the 13 strains,Lactobacillus plantarumCIRM653, was also able to disruptKlebsiella pneumoniaepreformed biofilms. Similarly, Viera et al. demonstrated thatBifidobacterium longum5 effectively reduced the severity ofK. pneumoniaeinfections in mice and reduced the mortality rates of the studied mice by 50%. The antibacterial mechanism ofBifidobacterium longum5 involves stimulating the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, neutrophil recruitment, and reducing the bacterial load in infected lungs [41]. In a study performed by Sikorska and Smoragiewicz, the results demonstrated that several bacteriocins produced by numerousLactobacillusprobiotics were effective in preventing MRSA biofilm formation [42]. Several studies have evaluated the efficacy of probiotic bacteriocins in combating bacterial pathogens. The results of experimental models and clinical trials reveal that probiotics serve as promising alternatives to antibiotics; however, further research is needed to determine the preservation of cell viability and dose optimization treatment with probiotics [43].3.6. Nanomaterials and NanoparticlesRecent studies have highlighted the benefits of utilizing nanomaterials, including nanoparticles (NPs) and nano-drug carriers, to treat a wide range of infections, especially those caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains. The mechanisms of nanoparticles can be classified into the following two categories: enhancing the effects of current antibiotics and exerting new bactericidal effects that are independent of existing antibiotics. In the first category, nanomaterials can serve as vehicles to deliver antibiotics into bacterial cells while bypassing cellular barriers and delivering the antibiotic to exert its effects in the cytoplasm of the bacterial target. This mechanism is favorable because it allows for the timed release of antibiotics from encapsulated nanoparticles. The slow release of the antibiotic not only lowers the required dosage and associated side effect profile but also enhances the pharmacokinetics, therapeutic index, and cost-effectiveness of the drug [18,44]. Extensive research of nanoparticles in combination with commercially available antibiotics has been conducted to determine the optimal combinations against MDR microorganisms. The preparation of the nanoparticles to serve as vehicles involves the following two types of interactions: physical and chemical. Physical interactions are based on interactions, including hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. On the other hand, chemical interactions involve the chemical bonding between functional groups of the nanoparticles and the antibiotic agent. For example, hydrogen-functionalized nanoparticles are conjugated with the drugs with an amine group, aldehyde-functionalized NPs are conjugated with the drugs with a hydrazide group, and gold NPs are conjugated with the drugs containing sulfhydryl groups [45] In the second category, nanomaterials exert bactericidal effects through physical and biochemical processes [44]. Bacterial cell walls are typically negatively charged. Therefore, nanoparticles are usually designed to encompass a positively charged polymer coating to allow for electrostatic interaction when the NP encounters the anionic cell membrane. This interaction leads to destruction of the bacterial cell membrane, prevents bacterial proliferation, and prevents biofilms from forming. Nanoparticles are often fused with metals (e.g., silver, gold, aluminum, and copper) to induce these bactericidal effects. Gold, silver, and copper nanoparticles cause physical damage to the cell wall of the host followed by cell lysis. Silver nanoparticles produce reactive oxidative species that damage peptidoglycan structures found in bacterial cell walls [32]. Researchers are investigating the effectiveness of various nanoparticle-based metal alloys and nano-drug carries to combat MDR bacteria, as well as their potential to inhibit biofilm formation [18]. An in vitro study [22] revealed that chemically synthesized gold nanoparticles were effective against numerous drug-resistant bacterial strains, includingStaphylococcus aureus,Enterococcus faecium,Enterococcus faecalis,Escherichia coli,Vibrio cholerae, andSalmonella typhimurium. Zinc oxide nanoparticles have shown antimicrobial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, includingEscherichia coliandPseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as Gram-positive bacteria, includingBacillus subtilisandStaphylococcus aureus[20]. Likewise, Tiwari et al. demonstrated that chemically synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles were successful in inhibiting the growth of carbapenem-resistantAcinetobacter baumanniistrains [46]. Titanium dioxide nanoparticles have been studied for their unique antimicrobial properties, as well. Studies have revealed that these NPs have strong antibacterial activity againstStaphylococcus aureusandEscherichia coli[20]. Overall, researchers have identified antibiotic\u2013nanoparticle conjugates as an innovative category of antimicrobial agents that address the challenges posed by MDR bacterial infections. The unique properties of nanoparticles allow for extended binding, the precise targeting of antibiotics at the target site, and shielding from lytic enzymes. As a result, when the antibiotic is delivered by an NP, a higher concentration of the drug reaches the bacterial cell, thereby eliminating higher dose requirements and reducing negative side effects [45].3.7. CannabinoidsAs ongoing research focuses on developing new alternatives to antibiotics, compounds with previously described antimicrobial effects are being reassessed as potential therapeutic agents in treating infectious diseases. The antimicrobial characteristics of cannabinoids have been recognized since the middle of the 20th century [47]. Researchers have started to reinvestigate natural products as they work to address the prevailing antibiotic crisis because natural products have consistently served as a valuable source for the identification of antimicrobial drug candidates [48]. In recent years, there have been many studies conducted to evaluate the medicinal applications of cannabinoids, which are found inCannabisplants (Figure 4). The results of numerous preclinical safety studies and clinical studies highlight the potential antimicrobial applications of multiple substances found inCannabisplants [49]. Cannabinoids can be categorized as either endogenous or exogenous when produced synthetically. Both exogenous and endogenous cannabinoids interact with CB1 and CB2 receptors [50]. In the treatment of bacterial infections in animal models, the results demonstrated that exogenous cannabinoids, particularly tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), can minimize resistance to numerous pathogens, includingListeria monocytogenes,Treponema pallidum,Legionella pneumophila, andStaphylococcus aureus[51]. Another exogenous cannabinoid, cannabidiol (CBD), has been studied in numerous in vitro studies. The results of these studies demonstrated that CBD has both bacteriostatic, as well as bactericidal, activity against several bacteria, including methicillin-susceptibleStaphylococcus aureus(MSSA), methicillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus(MRSA),Streptococcus mutans, andStreptococcus faecalis[48,49]. Similarly, in a study conducted by Luz-Veiga et al., the results indicated that CBD displayed antimicrobial effects againstPseudomonas aeruginosaandEscherichia coli[52]. Cannabinoids are useful against MDR pathogens because they can prevent biofilm formation, minimize biofilm metabolic activity, and prevent bacterial cell survival within the biofilm [49]. In addition, cannabinoids can be useful for enhancing the activity of current antibiotics when used synergistically with antibiotics. For example, CBD exhibited synergistic effects when combined with ampicillin to combat MRSA biofilms. Likewise, when CBD was utilized as a synergistic agent with erythromycin, vancomycin, rifampicin, or colistin, CBD\u2019s antimicrobial effects were amplified against target pathogens such asE. coliand MRSA. Cannabinoids have also been studied for their antifungal potential. Research indicates thatCannabismetabolites can also be used to inhibit pathogenic fungi; however, their antifungal properties have not been as extensively investigated as their antibacterial properties [47]. Overall, these results highlight the broad applications of cannabinoids as antimicrobial therapeutic alternatives.4. ConclusionsAntimicrobial resistance is a serious global health problem. Several factors are responsible for the resistance, including the following: 1. the decline in the development of new novel antibiotics; 2. the large-scale use of triclosan in consumer products, including toothpaste and cleansers, has negatively impacted antibiotic efficacy; 3. the change in the gene expression of bacteria cells dispersed from a biofilm has resulted in the prevalence of more virulent microbes. Collectively, the mechanisms responsible for the increase in antimicrobial-resistant microbes clearly suggests that alternative antimicrobial therapeutic options need to be explored and developed. A focus is needed to develop biofilm-dispersing agents that will discharge planktonic microbial cells to a more vulnerable planktonic state. On the positive side, good progress has been made with natural products, including bacteriocins, probiotics, bacteriophages, and cannabinoids, as well as synthetic entities nanomaterials, and nanoparticles. A concerted effort is needed to transition the alternative antimicrobial platforms from research potential to patient use in a timely manner.FundingThis research received no external funding.Conflicts of InterestThe authors declare no conflict of interest."

        "abstract": "The rhizosphere of a plant is home to helpful microorganisms called plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR), which play a crucial role in promoting plant growth and development. The significance of PGPR for long-term agricultural viability is outlined in this review. Plant growth processes such as nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, and hormone secretion are discussed. Increased plant tolerance to biotic and abiotic stress, reduced use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and enhanced nutrient availability, soil fertility, and absorption are all mentioned as potential benefits of PGPR. PGPR has multiple ecological and practical functions in the soil\u2019s rhizosphere. One of PGPR\u2019s various roles in agroecosystems is to increase the synthesis of phytohormones and other metabolites, which have a direct impact on plant growth. Phytopathogens can be stopped in their tracks, a plant\u2019s natural defenses can be bolstered, and so on. PGPR also helps clean up the soil through a process called bioremediation. The PGPR\u2019s many functions include indole acetic acid (IAA) production, ammonia (NH3) production, hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production, catalase production, and more. In addition to aiding in nutrient uptake, PGPR controls the production of a hormone that increases root size and strength. Improving crop yield, decreasing environmental pollution, and guaranteeing food security are only some of the ecological and economic benefits of employing PGPR for sustainable agriculture.",

        "content": "1. IntroductionThe global agricultural system is facing additional difficulties in the twenty-first century, including a drop in productivity and deterioration in the sustainability of agricultural ecosystems [1]. Forecasts by the United Nations [2] project that the global population will reach 9.7 billion people by 2050, resulting in a steady rise in food demand and its constrained available supply [3]. Due to climate change, major cereal crops have seen significant production losses, with yield decreases of about 3.8 percent and five percent in reference to corn and wheat separately [4]. Temperature rises have brought major rises in global temperatures and the appearance of various abiotic factors that have a negative impact on agricultural output [5]. Many harmful abiotic environmental factors, such as salinity, are turning arable land into barren land. This is because salinity drastically changes plant growth and metabolism, resulting in changes in plant physiology, morphology, and biochemistry [6]. By 2050, climate change will cause drought to impact over 50% of arable land [7]. Drought affects crop hydration association, photosynthetic integration, and supplement utilization [7]. Heavy metal contamination is hard to remove and needed in small amounts for plant metabolic activities, but high levels harm the phytological and microbiological networks.Food is a necessity for survival and plays a crucial role in individual and societal development. Reduced crop yields are a major cause for alarm. Pressure from a growing population on farmland to produce more food has resulted in the widespread usage of chemical inputs like fertilizers, herbicides, and insecticides. Through bioaccumulation and biomagnification, the effects of agrochemical runoff from such land have a negative impact on life on Earth. The use of insecticides to combat plant diseases has unintended consequences for beneficial insects, soil fertility, and soil microbiota [8]. Current harmful farming methods do not meet our needs and cannot provide a sustainable future. Sustainable agriculture has become increasingly important in recent times due to its focus on long-term environmental and social benefits.Recognizing the importance of sustainable farming practices is crucial for meeting the future economic needs of the world, as they can help reduce the use of artificial pesticides and fertilizers while improving plant health and soil quality [9].To secure long-term environmental health worldwide and produce adequate food for future generations, sustainable agriculture must preserve the soil\u2019s inherent diversity [3]. Thus, eco-friendly alternatives, including the sustainable use of beneficial microorganisms, are crucial for alleviating environmental stress. Bacteria, known as PGPR, are the most important of all the soil microbes. The benefits for the crop are achieved in many ways, such as fixing nitrogen, breaking down phosphate, getting rid of heavy metals, making phytohormones (like auxin, gibberellins, cytokinin, etc.), breaking down crop residue, and stopping phytopathogens from growing [10].Researcher [11] demonstrated that PGPRs boost plant vitality and promote development without releasing harmful byproducts into the atmosphere. With over 500 species, Streptomyces is the largest genus of Actinobacteria and a type genus of the Streptomycetaceae family among PGPRs [12].Crop production requires PGPR to boost plant nutrient availability. PGPR influences plant growth either directly or indirectly through root colonization [13]. PGPR enhances plant growth by bioremediating polluted soils through the sequestration of toxic heavy metal species and the degradation of xenobiotic compounds like pesticides. Additionally, they mobilize nutrients in soils, produce plant growth regulators, protect plants from phytopathogens by controlling or inhibiting them, and improve soil structure [14].Rhizosphere bacteria help cycle carbon through the earth and the environment and prevent soil carbon loss through metabolic activity. PGPRs can effectively control plant diseases brought on by fungi and bacteria. The phytomicrobiome\u2014a group of beneficial bacteria\u2014improves plant resilience to biotic and abiotic stress and agricultural productivity. PGPR, a beneficial phytomicrobiome component, promotes plants\u2019 responses to biotic stress by producing chemical messengers, boosting their intake of nutrients, and releasing antibiotics [15].This research review delves into the positive aspects of PGPR and how it can be combined with nanotechnology to make plants more resilient to harmful biotic and abiotic elements, improve agricultural production, and ultimately benefit the environment and the economy.2. Benefits of Rhizobial Associations for Plant GrowthTwo to five percent of rhizobacteria have a major impact on plant development when reintroduced by plants inoculated in soil containing competing microorganisms; these are known as PGPR.The social network in which a plant grows in nature is both dynamic and constant; the plant does not exist in isolation. Microorganisms surrounding the plant always organize and maintain the colony [16]. PGPRs are rhizobacteria that help plants flourish. In the soil\u2019s rhizosphere, its lowermost layer near plant roots, a group of helpful bacteria is found. These bacteria establish a cooperative relationship with plants and offer a variety of benefits that promote plant growth [17]. Microbiome interactions exist in all multicellular creatures and, presumably, all eukaryotes. These interactions may actually predate the settlement of plants in the region. Soil contains a wide variety of microbes, with bacteria being the most common type. Where soil bacteria and plant roots come into contact with one another is in the rhizosphere, which frequently has a higher microbial density. The beneficial bacteria either live in the soil freely or work in symbiotic relationships with the plant, but they are present nearby or even inside the plant [18]. The root-tip environment (or rhizosphere) harbors a multitude of living creatures. Lazarovits [19] discovered that root system functions, such as breathing and root secretion, affect the rhizosphere quantitatively and qualitatively. The plant, soil, bacteria, and soil microbes all interact significantly and widely in the rhizosphere. According to researcher [20], these predate the arrival of plants in the region. It is possible that these connections matter greatly and affect plant development and crop yield. When two or more types of microflora are present, PGPR can multiply and colonize every ecological niche on the roots at every stage of plant development. The age, stage of growth, species of plant, soil tissue, and ecological circumstances all have an effect on the activities of the microbes in the rhizosphere. Because of their quick development and adaptability, bacteria can take up carbon and nitrogen from the bulk of the rhizosphere\u2019s microbial population. Some PGPRs can create antimicrobial substances that stop the development of plant pathogens, shielding the plant from disease, as highlighted inFigure 1[21].Researchers have thoroughly studied the positive impacts of PGPR, a naturally occurring soil bacterium, on plant vitality and output. In addition to protecting plants from pathogens and harsh conditions, they can also boost nutrient availability, spur plant growth, fortify root development, and more [18]. Several different mechanisms are involved in how PGPR helps plants. Some PGPR form auxins, cytokinins, and gibberellins, which encourage root and shoot growth [18].PGPRs can easily use the process of \u201cfixation\u201d to convert nitrogen in the air into a plant-available form, thereby augmenting the plant\u2019s nitrogen needs. PGPRs solubilize phosphorus and other mineral nutrients, increasing their availability to plants. PGPR competes with dangerous microbes for oxygen, food, and room by colonizing the rhizosphere, which lowers the danger of pathogen invasion and boosts plant health in general. PGPR improves plant resistance by activating defensive systems and enhancing tolerance to a wide range of environmental factors, including dryness, salinity, and extreme heat. Soil has many different kinds of bacteria and viruses, primarily bacteria.In sustainable agricultural techniques, the application of PGPR as bio-fertilizers and bio-pesticides has attracted a lot of attention. The frequent use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers in conventional agricultural practices can have negative impacts on human health, the environment, and the sustainability of agricultural output [22]. Therefore, sustainable and environmentally friendly methods are becoming increasingly important to increase plant growth and improve agricultural productivity. In recent years, PGPR has surfaced as a viable option for long-term farming success [23].PGPR provides a viable method to promote plant development, enhance crop output, and mitigate ecological damage caused by agricultural practices, considering all variables. Furthermore, this text reveals the mechanisms of PGPR and their applications in microbial and plant interactions, as well as sustainable agriculture.3. The Growth-Promoting Mechanism in Plants: PGPR as a MediatorRhizosphere microorganisms are beneficial microbes that use a range of strategies to promote plant growth, as illustrated inFigure 2on plant-PGPR interactions [24]. The following are significant contributions that PGPR makes to environmentally friendly farming: direct and indirect means exist for PGPR to stimulate plant development.3.1. Direct MechanismBy fixing nitrogen, mineralizing organic compounds, solubilizing mineral nutrients, and producing phytohormones, PGPR can directly help plant growth and development through processes like nutrient intake or increased access to nutrition [24].3.1.1. Nitrogen (N) FixationThe majority of plant biochemical processes, like the synthesis of proteins and photosynthesis, depend on nitrogen (N), making it one of the most crucial minerals plants need to thrive [25]. Dinitrogen, which comprises 79% of nitrogen in the atmosphere, has a triplet covalent bond and a relatively small amount of reactivity; therefore, plants cannot utilize it directly. As the most effective method of adding nitrogen, nitrogen fertilizers have become an essential component of the cultivation of crops and methods in agriculture. But their disproportionate and persistent use is polluting the environment, causing eutrophication, deadly discharges into the environment, poisonous deposition in water in the ground, and other water bodies\u2014all of which are either directly or indirectly contributing to climate change. According to Bouchet [26], cropping systems only recover about half of the applied nitrogen; the other half either escapes from the soil by volatilization, leaching, or runoff or stays in the soil as organic complexes, which make up roughly 98% of the overall quantity of soil nitrogen. Symbiotic nitrogen-fixing organisms form a mutually beneficial connection with their host, as opposed to free-living nitrogen fixers and their host plants.Rhizobium,Azoarcus,Mesorhizobium,Frankia,Burkholderia, and several strains ofAchromobacterare all symbiotic nitrogen fixers [27,28]. These bacterial taxa, along with a few others, have earned their reputation as nitrogen-fixing PGPRs capable of significantly boosting plant growth and harvest [29]. A highly conserved and energy-demanding enzyme known as nitrogenase is responsible for fixing nitrogen. Two metalloprotein subunits make up the typical nitrogenase. The energy required by these bacteria to convert atmospheric nitrogen into usable forms is considerable. The bacteria require 16 moles of ATP to fix every mole of nitrogen, with the majority of this energy originating from the oxidation of organic molecules. Photoautotrophs are microorganisms that can photosynthesize their own carbohydrates, while nitrogen fixers that do not use photosynthesis rely entirely on other organisms to obtain these energy-rich molecules.Legumes make up 80 Tg of the 175 Tg of nitrogen fixed annually as a result of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Each legume fixes between 20 kg to 200 kg of nitrogen annually. Industrial nitrogen fixation, which produces nitrogen fertilizers, accounts for approximately half of the nitrogen fixed annually [30]. Seventy-plus percent of legumes form mutualistic relationships with rhizobia and are capable of fixing up to two hundred kg of nitrogen per square meter. Through symbiotic links with bacteria, legumes fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, reducing their need for additional nitrogen until large amounts of N-fertilizers are applied. Using the provided fertilizer requires a lesser amount of energy than atmospheric N2repair, which causes them to reduce or stop their nitrogen fixation. Spraying biologically nitrogen-fixing PGPR onto crops and crop fields increases growth, combats illness, and keeps the soil\u2019s nitrogen content stable for farming.3.1.2. Phosphate DissolutionThe second essential ingredient for plants is phosphorus (P). Important functions that rely on it include breathing, signal transduction, transmission of energy, photosynthesis, and macromolecular biosynthesis [30]. Plants struggle to absorb phosphorus because 99 percent of the available phosphorus becomes immobilized or precipitated, rendering it water-insoluble. Researchers have estimated that only 0.1% of the combined phosphorus concentration in soil and plant availability is due to the poor solubility of phosphorus and its preference for organic compounds and the soil matrix [31]. Plants absorb phosphorus exclusively as monobasic (H2PO4) and dibasic (HPO4)2\u2212ions [32].Applying phosphorus-based fertilizers to the soil replenishes a plant\u2019s quick access to the phosphorus already present in the substrate, remedying phosphate deficiency. Commercial fertilizer supplementation with phosphorus, however, is a costly process, and the phosphorus is frequently inhospitable to vegetation because the soil might readily lose it, mix with local waterways, and contaminate aquatic as well as terrestrial ecosystems [33].A wide variety of advantageous microorganisms, such as soil-dwelling bacteria and fungi and those affiliated with plant roots, possess the ability to solubilize soil phosphorus that would otherwise be insoluble. Researcher [34] reported a 25% decrease in the amount of P required by phosphorus solubilizing bacteria (PSB). Khan et al. [32] reported an increase in PSB\u2019s influence when mixed with other PGPRs.The primary method used by practically all bacteria that can dissolve metabolites, most often organic acids, requires phosphorus for their synthesis in the ketone and gluconic acid ketoforms, in which the cations are chelated and attached to their respective hydroxyl and carboxyl groups in phosphate [35] so that they can be dissolved into the soil solution and made available for plant uptake.Arthrobacter,Bacillus,Burkholderia,Enterobacter,Microbacterium,Pseudomonas,Rhizobium,Mesorhizobium,Flavobacterium, andSerratiaare some of the genera that have PGPR bacteria that can dissolve phosphorus [36].Mesomerhizobium ciceriandMesomerhizobium mediterraneum, both of which have been isolated from chickpea nodules [37], are two of these phosphate-solubilizing bacteria. Despite the fact that these bacteria solubilize phosphorus by increasing soil fertility, there have been few investigations into their application as biofertilizers. The low solubility of phosphorus often limits its availability in the soil [38]. Solubilizing insoluble phosphorus molecules in the soil is a special property of some PGPRs that makes them more accessible to plants.3.1.3. Potassium DissolutionPotassium (K) is the third essential component plants need. Since more than ninety percent of potassium is already in existence as insoluble rocks and mineral silicates, the soluble potassium content in soil is often quite low. The potassium deficit severely limits the production of crops. Without enough potassium, plants produce fewer seeds, grow more slowly, and produce less of a crop.Numerous microorganisms can solubilize potassium (K) in soil and interact closely with plants, particularly bacterial and fungal species [39]. Researchers have extensively investigated the potential of PGPR to produce and secrete organic acids that can dissolve potassium rocks.Acidothiobacillussp.,Bacillus edaphicus,Ferrooxidanssp.,Bacillus mucilaginosus,Pseudomonassp., andBurkholderiaarearesome PGPRs that can dissolve potassium [40]. Researchers have found thatPaenibacillussp. converts potassium from inaccessible mineral forms found in soils. According to research on the effects of plant growth-stimulating microorganisms (PGPM), K-solubilizing microbes make organic acids that make potassium more available, which in turn helps plants grow. Soil microorganisms increase the acidity of the soil\u2019s rhizosphere by producing oxalate, acid citrate, acetate, ferulic acid, and coumaric acid, all examples of organic acids. This accelerates the rate at which minerals dissolve and generate protons, resulting in the solubilization of the mineral K. Therefore, scientists have concluded that PGPM, like PSB, could be an efficient organic fertilizer, boosting the accessibility of plant nutrients and permitting less use of artificial fertilizers [41].3.1.4. Producing SiderophoreBacteria produce siderophores, small chemical compounds, in situations with little iron to enhance their iron absorption capacity. Iron is essential for all photosynthesis-based organisms due to its role as a vital enzyme cofactor in several metabolic activities, including photosynthesis, amino acid synthesis, oxygen transfer, nitrogen fixation, and respiration [42]. Iron is a prevalent chemical component on Earth, often found in two oxidative states: Fe2+and Fe3+. Plants have limited access to the later state due to the formation of insoluble iron oxides and hydroxides [43]. Research indicates that some plant growth-promoting bacteria (PGPB) produce low-molecular-weight chemicals (400\u20131500 Da) that have the ability to extract iron from the soil [44]. Siderophores are chemicals that bind to iron and enhance its bioavailability in plants [45]. Scientists have isolated and analyzed several microorganisms from both oceanic and land environments in order to assess their ability to produce siderophores [46]. The four main chemical structures of siderophores are phenolates, hydroxamates, pyoverdines, and carboxylates. The main Gram-negative bacteria that make siderophores areEnterobacterandPseudomonas. On the other hand, only 2% of Gram-positive species, likeBacillusandRhodococcus, can do the same [47]. Siderophore production by good microbes in the soil and on plants is an important biological control mechanism because it out competes harmful plant pathogens for iron resources, stopping them from accessing them [43].3.1.5. Zinc SolubilizationZinc (Zn) is a necessary plant micronutrient that ranges in concentration from 5 to 100 mg kgand is vital for plant growth and development [48]. The production of chlorophyll, the activation of enzymes involved in auxin and glucose metabolism, and the biosynthesis of proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids are only a few of the important physiological processes for which Zn is essential in plants [49]. It also aids plant survival in emerging climate circumstances, when plants must withstand increased temperatures and drought swings [50]. According to the FAO [51], zinc deficiency affects more than fifty percent of global soils, mostly because Zn is associated with naturally occurring mineral forms that are often inaccessible to plants, like zincite, zinc silicates, willemite, and zinc sulfide [52].Application of inorganic fertilizers can correct a zinc shortage, although doing so causes some environmental harm and renders a significant portion of the fertilizer unavailable to plants. PGPR is preferable due to its ability to completely fill cation-containing minerals found in nature [53]. Certain bacteria and fungi saturate zinc in insoluble forms in the rhizosphere, thereby increasing the availability of zinc nutrients. Zn-mobilizing PGPR significantly boosts the yield of cereal crops like maize, wheat, and rice, as proven in numerous experiments [52]. Because of the rapidly expanding global population, there is a growing demand for staple foods, which in turn increases the demand for pesticides and artificial fertilizers. However, this could have a negative impact on the environment. Even though biofertilizers may not totally replace mineral fertilizers, increasing crop yields with the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides is essential to feed the world\u2019s growing population.3.2. Indirect MechanismBy creating repressive chemicals that boost the host\u2019s inherent resistance, PGPR uses roundabout means to protect plants from or lessen the impact of phytopathogens. The roles that PGPR plays in this process include making hydrolytic enzymes (chitinases, cellulases, etc.), antibiotics in response to plant pathogens or disease resistance, protecting the plant\u2019s whole system from different pathogens and pests, and making VOCs and exudates viaphotosynthesis, among other things.3.2.1. Stress ManagementStress refers to anything that acts as a barrier to development in a plant. A fundamental hurdle to long-term agricultural output is the multitude of stresses caused by the soil environment on plant growth. We can divide these pressures into biotic and abiotic groups. The main factor behind the more than 30% global crop loss is abiotic stress. The most common type of abiotic stress that hinders plant growth and productivity is drought or aridity stress, caused by dryness, salinity, and high temperatures, as shown inFigure 3[54]. Researchers have extensively studied the role of PGPR in protecting plants from environmental stresses, utilizing microorganism strains likePseudomonas putidaandPseudomonas fluorescens, which significantly affect water salinity and other abiotic stresses and are capable of removing cadmium ions from the ground [55]. Various pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, nematodes, protists, insects, and viroids, can produce biotic stress, which significantly lowers agricultural productivity [56]. Biotic stress has far-reaching consequences for plant health, including effects on plant health in greenhouses, natural habitat ecology, nitrogen cycling in ecological systems, and other horticultural concerns. These issues could be addressed and worked on using strains ofPaenibacilluspolymyxaB2, B3, and B4,Bacillus amyloliquefaciensHYD-B17, HYDGRFB19,P. favisporusHYTAPB30, andB. subtilisRMPB44.3.2.2. Hydrolytic Enzymes ProductionPGPR generates protective enzymes, categorizing its action as a biopesticide. By inhibiting phytopathogenic agents, PGPR stimulates plant growth and produces compounds with antibiosis and antifungal characteristics that serve as defense mechanisms. Chitinase and glucanase are two examples of hydrolyzing enzymes created throughout the process. Bacteria that produce chitinases and beta-glucanases would inhibit fungal growth because these components make up the bulk of a fungal cell wall.Sinorhizobiumfredii KCC5andPseudomonas fluorescens LPK2make chitinase and beta-glucanase, which stopFusarium udumfrom making plants wilt [57].3.2.3. VOCs FormationInducing systemic resistance in plants against phytopathogens and suppressing bacterial, fungal, and nematode infections are only a few of the many benefits that result from the production of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by PGPR. Several microbial genera, likePseudomonas,Bacillus,Arthrobacter,Stenotrophomonas, andSerratia,include specific bacterial species that have an impact on plant growth.Bacillusspp. produce the best VOCs, including 2-butanediol and acetoin, for preventing the spread of fungi and encouraging plant development [58].3.2.4. Exopolysaccharide (EPS) ProductionDiverse types of bacteria, algae, and plants create biodegradable polymers called EPSs. Bacteria, algae, and plants construct EPSs from glucose residues and their analogs [59]. EPSs sustain the host under stress (from salty soil, drought, or too much moisture) by holding water reserves, aggregating soil particles, and facilitating obligatory rhizobacteria, which are bacteria that interact with plant roots. Some PGPRs that make EPS, likeRhizobium leguminosarum,Azotobacter,Bacillus drentensis,Agrobacteriumsp.,Xanthomonassp., andRhizobiumsp, make the soil more fertile and help farming. Mahmood et al. [60] examined how salinity affected mung bean physiology, growth, and yield. In hard natural saline conditions, researchers evaluated the efficiency of foliar spraying of silicon (Si) (1 and 2 kg ha\u22121) and two potential PGPRs (E. cloacaeandB. drentensis). Their study revealed that adding 2 kg Si ha\u22121to the PGPR strainB. drentensisincreased gaseous exchange, water relations, photosynthetic pigments, growth, and seed production in saline irrigation. Si and PGPR in agriculture reduce mung bean salinity stress sustainably.3.2.5. Antibiotic ProductionMicrobial antagonists can replace traditional pesticides to combat plant diseases in agricultural crops. By producing antibiotics, PGPR is crucial in preventing the spread of disease-causing bacteria, together withBacillusspp. andPseudomonassp. One of the most promising areas of plant sciences in the last 20 years has been the production of antibiotics by PGPR to fend off numerous plant-based pathogens and extensively researched bio-control mechanisms [61]. The vast majority ofPseudomonasspecies produce antibiotics such as oomycin A, cepaciamide A, ecomycins, and viscosin. Other medicines manufactured byPseudomonasinclude pyrrolnitrin, pyoluteorin, 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol, rhamnolipids, and pyoluteorin. Bacillus species produce a number of lipopeptide antibiotics, such as surfactin and bacillomycin, along with an assortment of other antibiotics and antifungal drugs. Further classification of the bactericides involves dividing them into volatile and non-volatile substances. Polyketides, cyclic lipopeptides, aminopolyols, heterocyclic nitrogenous chemicals, etc., are all examples of non-volatile antibiotics. To name a few examples, volatile antibiotics include alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, hydrogen cyanide, and so on [62].3.2.6. Plant Growth Hormone ProductionPhytohormones, as well as plant growth hormones, have an impact on plant maturation and growth even at minimal doses (<1 mM) [63]. When certain bacteria possess the intrinsic ability to control the production of different growth regulator enzymes, they are considered plant growth regulators or phytostimulators. It may even encourage plants to produce these phytohormones. The root cell produces an excess of auxins, cytokinins, abscisic acid, ethylene, brassinosteroids, and gibberellins. These chemicals affect the root\u2019s beginning, roots on both sides, and hairs on the roots, which makes the plant take in more water and nutrients. Symbiotic and endophytic bacteria, which live in close proximity to plants\u2019 roots, produce phytohormones that affect seed germination, root system expansion to increase nutrient absorption, the development or elaboration of vascular tissues, shoot extension, flowering, and general plant growth [64].IAA, cytokinins, gibberellins, and ethylene synthesis inhibitors are among the compounds that PGPRs generate. IAA phytostimulators made by PGPRs affect plant growth at the tips, phototropism, geotropism, cell division, root initiation, and other things [65]. An amino acid that is frequently present in root exudates is tryptophan. It serves as the primary precursor molecule in bacteria for the production of IAA [66]. IAA-producing microbes might be able to remove potentially toxic levels of tryptophan and tryptophan analogs from their cells. Plant cytokinins stop the main root system from growing bigger and encourage cell division, lateral root development, and the growth of root hairs. Gibberellins, on the other hand, encourage stem tissue, root lengthening, and root elongation to the side. One important phytohormone, ethylene, has many biological processes that might influence plant growth and improvement. It accelerates seed germination, limits the elongation of roots, aids in the maturation of the fruit, cuts down on leaf withering, boosts crop production, and causes further plant hormone synthesis to increase. It is also crucial in the process of root formation. Some of the PGPRs that are linked to making phytostimulatorsare Bacillus, Pantoea, Arthrobacter, Pseudomonas, Enterobacter, Brevundimonas, and Burgholderia [67].4. PGPR Used in Vegetable ProductionVarious processes, such as the mineralization of organic matter, nutrient immobilization, phosphate solubilization, nitrogen nitrification, and phytohormone production, combine to enhance soil fertility and crop productivity. Rhizobacteria attached to roots produce a high quantity of biomolecules in the soil for further health benefits. Numerous volatile substances and additional compounds (such as enzymes, proteins, etc.) produced by PGPR improve soil quality and encourage plant growth. Numerous bacteria from various genera, such asBacillus,Pseudomonas,Arthrobacter, andStenotrophomonas, have been identified as producers of volatile compounds [18]. As researchers discover more about the plant growth-promoting mechanism of PGPR, they anticipate an increase in tomato production and a decrease in chemical inputs. Researchers in Ethiopia measured the effects of greenhouse conditions on root development in tomatoes and the role of Pseudomonas isolates, stems, and leaves differently, with the dry weight of leaves showing the most variability [68]. Additionally,PseudomonasAPF1 andB. subtilisB2G treatments resulted in the highest dry and fresh weight tomatoes ever reported [69].Trichodermaspp. andBacillusspp. established new benchmarks for growth rates, fruit production, and nutrient accessibility.5. PGPR Used in CropsThe Poaceae family includes the cereal plantZea maysL., more commonly known as corn. Among the many cereal crop species, it ranks among the biggest and most important on Earth. According to the International Grains Council [70], maize consumption worldwide will continue to rise until 2024, and the crop will see increased usage as animal feed. One of the three most important crop species in the world, maize provides almost half of the energy required by organisms in Africa and the Americas each day [71]. If we want to keep improving maize yield, we have to use more fertilizer, which will drive up production costs and make environmental problems worse. There are many well-established benefits to crop development and production from rhizobacteria that encourage plant growth. The biological answer that might boost crop productivity, adjust the atmospheric nitrogen, and slow down maize nitrogen recovery plants could be PGPR, according to researchers Kuan et al. [72]. Increased year rates of up to 39% with less fertilizer-N input are encouraged by the finding that plant-N remobilization is closely linked to plant aging. Because of its capacity to increase growth and grain output, PGPR is useful for cereal crops, particularly maize. Many different kinds of bacteria may produce IAA, antibiotics and this has positive effects on the nutrient uptake capacity of plants, as illustrated inTable 1. Phosphate solubilization and other as-yet-unstudied PGPR properties also contribute to plant development. Researchers are also studying the bioprotective role of PGPR in maize crops. One dangerous fungus that is intimately associated with maize isFusarium. According to Pereira et al. [73], some PGPR strains, likeBacillus amyloliquefaciensandMicrobacterium oleovorans, were able to keepFusarium verticillioidesaway from maize seeds. Additionally, some PGPR species may aid plant growth by acting as biocontrol agents and biofertilizers at the same time. As an example, isolates ofB. cepaciahave been identified that have biocontrol capabilities againstFusariumspp. Bevivino et al. [74] found that these microbes can promote maize development in environments with low iron levels by producing siderophores.Sugarcane is one of the first and most significant agricultural products. It is a hybrid of theSaccharumplant and has several uses in industry. It is best to grow sugarcane in tropical and subtropical climates for sugar production [75]. Sugarcane is significant on a worldwide scale due to the benefits associated with biofuel and biogas generation. When compared to other methods, PGPR has environmental and economic advantages since it increases sugarcane output while decreasing fertilizer use. One of the biggest challenges of growing sugarcane is soil that is not rich enough or nutrient-rich enough to meet the plant\u2019s needs, which makes it difficult to achieve significant yields. The element phosphorus (P) has the greatest impact on soil. Despite its relative insignificance compared to N and K, it plays a major role in sugarcanes ability to survive and build its root system [76].Table 1.Function of the Rhizosphere by a few chosen PGPR candidates.Table 1.Function of the Rhizosphere by a few chosen PGPR candidates.SpeciesRoleMechanism InvolvedParticipating PlantReferenceAgrobacterium radiobacterImproves bioprotectionAntibioticsMohanram and Kumar, 2019 [77]Azotobacter chroococcumAssists in biostimulationProduction of gibberellinCerealsZhang et al., 2019 [78]AzospirillumbrasilenseBiofertilisationPhosphate solubilisationMaize (Zea mays), Wheat (Triticum aestivumL.) and Rice (Oryza sativa)Lucy et al., 2004 [79]Bacillus cereusBoosts bioprotectionLipopeptidesInduced and acquired systemicresistanceBean (Phaseolus vulgaris)Tomato (S. lycopersicum)Hashami et al., 2019 [80]Bacillus subtilisBiofertilisationAids in biostimulationBioprotectionAmmonia synthesisThrough IAA and Cytokinin productionLipopeptidesCatalase productionMaize (Zea mays)Chickpea (Cicer arietinum)Tomato (S. lycopersicumL.)Cucumber (Cucumis sativus)Ouhaibi-Ben Abdeljali et al., 2016 [81],Tahir et al., 2017 [82]Klebsiella pneumoniaAids biofertilisationBioprotectionNitrogen fixationAcquired and induced systemicresistanceMaize (Zea mays)Peanut (Arachis hypogaea)Sharma et al., 2019 [83]Pseudomonas aeruginosaBioremediationCellulase productionRice (O. sativa), Pea (P. sativa)Cheng et al.,2019 [84]Staphylococcus saprophyticusBiostimulationManufacturing of IAAOrnamental speciesManzoor et al., 2019 [85]A combination of factors, including the absence of phosphorus in the initial material, clay absorption of phosphorus, and the precipitation of phosphorus with iron and aluminum oxides and hydroxides, causes inadequate phosphorus availability. Consequently, the usage of P fertilizers in sugarcane growing is substantial, leading to an increase in production costs. In the first year, a significant amount of the applied phosphorus fertilizer becomes fixed in the soil, rendering it unavailable for plant uptake. However, cane crop roots only absorb around 10 to 30 percent of that amount [86]. Therefore, it is critical to find fertilizers that do not include phosphate as soon as possible.A potential alternative to using mineral fertilizers like phosphate is PGPR, which may help enhance their performance while also producing sugarcane with little environmental impact [87]. Many studies that evaluated the effects of inoculating sugarcane with three different PGPR species and five different doses of P. Researchers discovered that inoculation improved crop yields while decreasing fertilizer expenses for farmers [88]. The most effective fertilizer management for sugarcane production, according to their data, was a combination ofAzospirillum umbrasilense, Bacillus subtilis, and cheap (P2O5). UsingB. subtilisalong with byproducts can improve soil fertility, lessen the bad effects of vinasse fertilization, encourage shoot and root growth, and create a synergistic effect that makes it possible to grow a lot of sugarcane with little damage to the environment [89]. Sugarcane crops treated with Azospirillum had better root systems, which meant more water and nutrient absorption and maybe higher yields [29]. This research showcased the complex relationship between several factors, such as auxin pools seen in native plants, by showing how cultivar, water regime, and Azospirillum inoculation interact with one another.6. Integration of PGPR and NanotechnologyGenetic manipulation opens a transformative avenue for enhancing PGPR strains, offering improved efficacy and the development of innovative variants. This integration of genetic advancements holds the promise of elevating PGPR-biotechnologies, fostering effectiveness, sustainability, and environmental friendliness in addressing plant stresses. In the realm of nanotechnology, advanced nations such as the United States, China, and Japan strategically harness sophisticated methodologies to substantially enhance agricultural productivity [90]. This strategic implementation involves a multifaceted exploration of cutting-edge techniques, encapsulating a variety of approaches aimed at optimizing key aspects of agricultural processes. Within the United States, nanotechnology applications in agriculture span various domains. Targeted delivery systems, precision farming, and enhanced nutrient management deploy nanomaterials, ranging from nanoparticles to nanostructured materials [91]. Nanosensors play a pivotal role in monitoring soil conditions, providing real-time data for precise irrigation and fertilization strategies. Additionally, nanomaterials contribute to controlled release systems for pesticides, minimizing environmental impact while maximizing effectiveness. China\u2019s approach involves integrating nanotechnology to address challenges in soil fertility and crop protection [92]. China\u2019s approach involves utilizing nanoparticles like zinc oxide and silica to enhance nutrient absorption, mitigate soil degradation, and improve overall crop health. The use of nanomaterials in nanofertilizers improves nutrient release and absorption by plants, which increases agricultural productivity.Table 2suggests that PGPR-mediated heavy metal bioremediation involves nanomaterials [92].Renowned for technological innovations, Japan explores nanotechnology to bolster sustainable agriculture. Nanomaterials, such as carbon nanoparticles and nanostructured materials, enhance seed germination, root development, and nutrient absorption [97]. Japan\u2019s focus on smart nanomaterials enables precise and efficient delivery of agricultural inputs, responding dynamically to environmental cues and ensuring optimal plant growth.The combination of PGPR and this sophisticated use of nanomaterials shows tremendous promise [98]. This interplay is crucial for agricultural nutrient absorption, disease detection, and increasing organismal tolerance to environmental and biological challenges [99]. Deliberately altering an organism\u2019s genetic material, usually DNA, is genetic manipulation, which is identical to genetic engineering. Genetic engineering enhances the favorable characteristics of strains in PGPR [100]. By carefully changing the bacterial genome, scientists can change many genes at once. This can help the bacteria make chemicals that help them grow, deal with stress, or use nutrients better [99]. You can manipulate the genetic composition of PGPR strains using techniques like CRISPR-Cas9, which permits specific modifications in bacterial DNA. By strategically integrating nanomaterials, the synergistic benefits of nanotechnology and PGPR may increase the overall efficacy of agriculture. The use of nanoparticles as delivery vehicles allows for the precise distribution of chemicals generated by PGPR to the roots of plants [101]. When you combine nanomaterials like nano-fertilizers with PGPR-enhanced nutrient availability, you can achieve the most out of absorption by controlling the release of nutrients.Smart nanomaterials respond instantly to environmental changes, such as changes in humidity, temperature, pH, or specific compounds [101]. These materials can adapt to various conditions, such as drought, by releasing chemicals like PGPR precisely when and where they are detected. Smart nanoparticles can precisely target the distribution of growth-promoting chemicals with minimal impact on the surrounding environment due to their adaptability. Complex systems that detect their environment, convey messages, and prohibit unauthorized access are the basis of intelligent nanomaterials\u2019 responses [90]. In reaction to environmental signals, PGPR may integrate with plant roots after detection via a controlled release. By incorporating feedback loops into specific systems, they may continuously adjust to new conditions, maximizing advantages while minimizing unnecessary application dangers. By utilizing nanotechnology and genetic engineering, the developed world demonstrates its commitment to improving agricultural practices. We can revolutionize global food production if we band together. Like in India, this may make it more efficient, eco-friendly, and capable of meeting the demands of a growing population.7. Conclusions and Future ProspectsPGPR brings about positive developments in sustainable agriculture through processes such as phytohormone synthesis, nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, and the biocontrol of plant diseases. Researchers have extensively studied the positive impacts of PGPR on many crops. These benefits include accelerated root and shoot growth rates, improved nutrient absorption, and enhanced tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. In view of the changing climate and limited resources, the ability of PGPR to improve plant development under harsh circumstances, such as drought and salinity, is very important.Final thoughts: PGPR is a promising plant growth enhancer for sustainable agriculture; fewer chemical inputs might lead to higher harvests. Further field research and testing must be conducted to completely discover the potential of PGPR and develop feasible, widespread applications. Eco-friendly PGPR approaches that significantly enhance plant growth and increase crop yields are now achievable due to these improvements.Author ContributionsConceptualization, Writing\u2014original draft preparation, Writing\u2014review & editing, Visualization, A.H.; Supervision, Visualization, Writing\u2014review & editing, B.T.; Visualization, Resources, Writing\u2014review & editing, M.H.; Writing\u2014review & editing, N.K.

IntroductionThe relationship between plants and microorganisms is of paramount importance in maintaining the delicate balance of life on Earth, as evidenced by their interconnectedness in the intricate tapestry of nature [1,2]. The relationship between plants and growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) is a noteworthy symbiotic partnership that holds significant implications for sustainable development [3,4]. In light of the pressing issues of food security, environmental degradation, and climate change, the potential of PGPR has emerged as a favorable solution for addressing these challenges [5]. PGPR, which are capable of displaying both antagonistic and synergistic interactions that ultimately lead to the enhancement of plant growth, offer a more comprehensive understanding of plant activity in conjunction with microbes [6,7,8]. PGPR significantly influence soil properties and play a critical role in transforming uncultivated, low-quality soil into cultivable soil [9]. To boost agricultural productivity, numerous regions around the globe are actively harnessing the potential of PGPR to improve soil quality and promote plant growth [10,11]. Generally, this strategy encompasses direct or indirect techniques. The direct method entails providing compounds that stimulate plant growth directly to plants [12]. This is accomplished through the application of methods like bio-fertilization, rhizo-remediation, and plant stress management [13]. The acquisition of water and nutrients from the soil is often the primary environmental factor that restricts the development of land-based plant species [14]. PGPR enhance plant growth by increasing the accessibility or absorption of nutrients from a finite pool of nutrients present in the soil [15]. PGPR can alleviate plant stress, both biotic and abiotic, which can negatively impact plant growth and development. By promoting plant health and resilience, PGPR can help to improve crop yields and quality [13]. Abiotic stress is a type of stress that is inflicted upon plants by their environment and can take the form of either physical or chemical stress [16]. Biotic stress poses a significant biological threat to humans. Nevertheless, cutting-edge biotechnology methods and the utilization of technologies like nano- and microencapsulation may help address these challenges [17]. This Special Issue has showcased a diverse array of studies investigating the possible function of PGPR, which exhibit both antagonistic and synergistic interactions that lead to improved plant growth. These studies offer a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between plants and microorganisms. The Special Issuecontains three articles and three reviews, which are briefly described in the following paragraphs. All published articles in this Special Issue highlight the importance of PGPR in agriculture, their mechanisms of action in disease control and plant growth promotion, and the current state of research in the field.2. An Overview of Published ArticlesThe study conducted by Al Amin et al. (2021) aimed to investigate a significant disease affectingOryza sativaL. crops in Bangladesh, known as \u201cBakanae\u201d. This disease causes considerable yield loss annually. The researchers collected thirty isolates ofFusariumspp. from infectedO. sativaL. plants across various agroecological zones in Bangladesh and analyzed the variations in morphological and cultural characteristics and pathogenicity. The study found that the isolates varied in terms of cultural characteristics such as shape, phialide, colony features, size of macro- andmicroconidia and chlamydospore formation. Based on these characteristics, the researchers identified threevariants ofFusariumspecies, includingF. proliferatum,F. moniliforme, andF. fujikuroi, on PDA media. Furthermore, Al Amin et al.\u2019s research assessed the efficacy of various bioagents, includingPseudomonas fluorescens,Bacillus subtilis,Trichodermaspp., andAchromobacterspp., against the virulent isolate ofF. moniliformein order to devise a strategy for managing bakanae disease in rice. The study\u2019s findings indicate that the use ofAchromobacterspp. andB. subtilisas biological control agents holds great promise for achieving environmentally friendly and effective control of bakanae disease in rice crops.The article authored by Khoshru et al. (Contribution 2) delves into the crucial role that manganese (Mn) plays in plant growth, as it functions as a co-factor for enzymes involved in antioxidant synthesis, photosynthesis, and defense against pathogens. Mn plays a vital role in plant growth and development, as it is also involved in root growth, nutrient uptake, and soil microbial communities. However, the availability of Mn in the soil can be limited due to factors such as organic matter content, soil pH, mineralogy, and redox potential. The excessive application of chemical fertilizers containing Mn can lead to negative consequences for the environment and human health, such as water and soil pollution. According to a review report by Khoshru et al., recent research emphasizes the significance of microbial interactions in enhancing Mn uptake in plants, contributing to an environmentally friendlier approach to addressing Mn deficiencies. Beneficial microbes take onvarious roles and employ various strategies, including organic acid production, pH reduction, and the promotion of root growth, to enhance Mn bioavailability. They also produce anti-pathogenic compounds, siderophores, and form symbiotic relationships with plants, thereby facilitating the transport, uptake of Mn, and stimulating plant growth while reducing negative environmental impacts. This review examines the influences impacting the mobility of Mn in the rhizosphere, soil, and plants and highlights the problems caused by Mn scarcity in the soil and the use of chemical fertilizers, including their consequences. The authors investigate the potential of different beneficial soil microorganisms in addressing these challenges using eco-friendly methods. The study concludes that microbial interactions could be a promising approach toimproving the uptake of Mn in plants, resulting in enhanced crop productivity and maintaining environmental sustainability.The research from Boya et al. (Contribution 3) exploresthe establishment of permanent preservation plots (PPPs) in natural forests and their significance in assessing the impact of climate change on forests. Two major forest areas in Bangalore were designated as PPPs in 2016 to facilitate long-term studies of climate change and monitor ecological changes, including vegetation. The primary objective of Boya\u2019s research was to investigate the factors contributing to the diversity of microorganisms, such as arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), in terms of biological nutrients and physical properties. The native tropical forest of Bangalore, located near Bannerghatta National Park (BNP), has not been extensively studied in terms of its microflora, particularly AMF. Therefore, the study aimed to quantify the AMF in the three one-hectare plots established in BNP and the Doresanipalya Reserve Forest (DRF) using the Centre for Tropical Forest Sciences (CTFS) protocol. The two plots established in BNP were located in the Thalewood House area (mixed, moist, deciduous type) and the Bugurikallu area (dry, deciduous type), while the plot established in DRF was located in dry, deciduous vegetation. Each plot was divided into twenty-five subplots (20 m \u00d7 20 m), and composite soil samples were collected during dry and wet seasons and analyzed for spore of AMF and available P content. The results of the study revealed the occurrence of AMF in all threeplots, with Doresanipalya being the highest, followed by the ThalewoodHouse plot and the Bugurikallu plot. The available P and AMF spore numbers presented correlations in all threeplots. Among the spores of AMF, theGlomusspecies were found to be the most dominant in all three plots. The study concluded that dry, deciduous forests accommodated more AMF spores than mixed, moist forests.The paper by Hasan et al. (Contribution 4) emphasizes the significance of the rhizosphere, which is the region surrounding the plant\u2019s root system and is inhabited by beneficial microorganisms known as PGPR. The review covers various plant growth processes, such as hormone secretion, phosphate solubilization, and nitrogen fixation, and emphasizes the potential benefits of PGPR. These benefits include increased plant tolerance to biotic andabiotic stress, reduced reliance on chemical fertilizers and pesticides, and enhanced soil fertility, absorption and nutrient availability. PGPR has multiple ecological and functions properties in the soil\u2019s rhizosphere and soil, amajor being to increase the phytohormones synthesis and other metabolites that directly impact on plant growth. Additionally, PGPR can help to combat plant pathogens and bolster the plant\u2019s natural defenses. Moreover, PGPR also aid in soil remediation through a process called bioremediation. Themultiple functions of PGPR include ammonia (NH3) production, indole acetic acid (IAA) production, catalase production, and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) production, among others. Also, PGPR help with nutrient uptake and control the production of a hormone that increases root size and strength. The study concludes that using PGPR for sustainable agriculture can provide ecological and economic benefits such as improving crop yield, reducing environmental pollution, and ensuring food security.The article authored by Singh et al. (Contribution 5) highlights the indiscriminate application of various agrochemicals, particularly fertilizers, by farmers across trapezoidal landscapes in order to boost productivity and cater to the growing demand for food. A significant portion of the population in developing countries is vulnerable to zinc (Zn) deficiency due to their major dependence on cereals as their primary source of calories. Zn, an essential major micronutrient for crops/plants, plays an important role throughout the plant lifecycle. Despite its crucial role in enhancing yield, it is often overlooked. One of the most commonly occurring micronutrient deficiencies, soil Zn deficiency, has a detrimental effect on crop yields. The inaccessibility of Zn in fixed forms to plants is the primary reason for Zn deficiency in both plants and soils, which characterizes the majority of agricultural soils. As a result, it is essential to employ sustainable and environmentally friendly methods to meet the demand for food. One feasible solution is the implementation of Zn-solubilizing bacteria (ZSB) for sustainable agriculture. This method involves inoculating plants and application with ZSB, which is a more efficient strategy for increasing the translocation of Zn in various edible plant components. ZSB possess crop growth promoting characteristics or attributes, making them effective bio-elicitors for promoting sustainable growth of crops through various mechanisms that are crucial for plant health and productivity. This article provides a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of ZSB, the practical characteristics of ZSB-mediated Zn localization, the mechanisms and roles underlying Zn solubilization, and the application of ZSB to enhance crop productivity and yield.The work by Khoshru et al. (Contribution 6) highlighted the importance of phosphorus (P) for crop production, emphasizing that it is one of the most crucial elements required for plant growth. The optimal soil pH for P absorption by plants is approximately 6.5; however, in acidic and alkaline soils, the P becomes insoluble and unavailable for plant absorption due to its interaction with calcium, iron, and aluminum elements. Although chemical fertilizers are primarily used to supply P to plants, their high cost and long-term environmental damage make them an unsustainable option. Consequently, researchers have explored alternative methods, such as using rock phosphate (RP), which is abundant and inexpensive. However, solubilizing P from RP has been a challenge. To address this, physical and chemical treatments have been employed, but recent attention has focused on the potential of rhizobacteria to solubilize RP and provide P to plants. Microorganisms employ various mechanisms, including the production of organic and mineral acids, proton secretion, and siderophore production, to solubilize RP, thereby enhancing the quality and quantity of agricultural products. The study by Khoshru and colleagues examined the potential of rhizosphere microbes, particularly rhizobacteria, as an environmentally friendly strategy for RP solubilization, in addition to physical and chemical solutions.3. ConclusionsThe symbiotic relationship between plants and PGPR has immense potential for sustainable agriculture and environmental interaction. By promoting plant growth and enhancing nutrient uptake efficiency, PGPR offer a natural and eco-friendly alternative to chemical fertilizers and pesticides, thereby reducing the environmental footprint of agricultural practices. Furthermore, their ability to confer resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses can bolster crop resilience in the face of climate variability and emerging pathogens, contributing to food security and agricultural sustainability.

This study investigates the effects of the R23I peptide on the protein abundance of Thermus thermophilus (T. thermophilus) at different concentrations (20, 50, and 100 \u03bcg/mL). We found 82 differentially expressed proteins, including 15 upregulated and 67 downregulated proteins. We also compared the protein identification results between the PEAKS and IdentiPy programs. Our proteomic analysis revealed distinct patterns of protein expression, suggesting compensatory mechanisms in response to the R23I peptide.

        "content": "1. IntroductionIn recent years, the attention of many researchers has been directed to the study of the structural features and mechanisms of action of antibacterial peptides [1,2,3,4]. This trend is due to the relevance of finding of new candidate molecules against the increasing number of pathogenic bacterial strains resistant to the action of traditional antibiotics [5,6,7]. Antibacterial peptides belong to a diverse group of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), which can be divided into natural and synthetic [8]. Natural AMPs are produced in the host\u2019s body constantly or in response to infection with a pathogen, while synthetic AMPs can be developed with the required properties [9,10]. The synthetic peptides and chemically modified natural AMPs can have new mechanisms of antimicrobial action, and their modification can enhance their antimicrobial effect as well as delay the resistance of pathogens to them [11,12]. The antimicrobial properties of such synthetic AMPs can be determined by their effects on the cellular processes of model bacteria [13,14]. Proteomic studies of bacterial cells provide valuable information about the proteins expressed in response to the extracellular and intracellular activity of AMPs [15,16].Label-free quantitative proteomics, based on the tandem mass spectrometry of digested proteins, is a powerful tool for the analysis and quantification of complex protein mixtures [17]. It is used for the analysis of both prokaryotic proteomes [18] and proteomes from eukaryotic tissues [19,20] or bodily fluids [21]. Modern quantitative approaches provide data for hundreds of proteins [22] and are relatively cheap [19].The R23I peptide is the first artificial hybrid AMP developed on the combination of a cell-penetrating peptide sequence and the amyloidogenic region of the S1 ribosomal protein fromThermus thermophilus[23]. AMP exhibits both amyloidogenic and antimicrobial properties; in particular, R23I is able to co-aggregate with the S1 ribosomal protein fromT. thermophilusand cause inhibition of bacterial growth in cell culture. The S1 ribosomal protein is the largest protein of the 30S ribosomal subunit and is associated with many important cellular processes, including the biosynthesis of other proteins [24,25]. In addition, the S1 protein is prone to aggregation, which is associated with the presence of amyloidogenic regions [26,27]. Such amyloidogenic regions can be in use as a basis for the synthesis of amyloid-antibacterial peptides [28]. That is why this protein was chosen as a target for the action of the synthetic amyloid-antimicrobial peptide R23I [29]. Antimicrobial peptides are a diverse group of molecules. Their mechanism of action is aimed at destroying the cell membrane or against intracellular targets. Ribosomes are one of the key targets, and interaction with them can lead to antimicrobial effects [30,31]. A number of works have been published describing the effect of antimicrobial peptides on the functional centers of the ribosome [32,33,34]. There are several known strategies for interrupting protein biosynthesis by antimicrobial peptides: disrupting the translation process by erroneous insertions of amino acids, preventing (blocking) the release of the newly synthesized polypeptide chain, and disrupting protein folding [35,36,37]. Investigating the mechanisms of action of AMPs is important for the discovery of new peptides, the development of new, more effective antibiotics, as well as for studying the regulation of the translation process. The mechanisms of the AMPs\u2019 action can also be studied usingT. thermophilus[38].T. thermophilusis a model organism and is widely used in the field of structural biology [39,40]. On the one hand, three-dimensional models ofT. thermophilusproteins play a significant role in solving problems in this area to explain decoding mechanisms [41]. The emergence of atomic structures 30S and 50S fromT. thermophilusand other organisms made it possible to summarize decades of research on the translation apparatus [39,42,43]. On the other hand, thermophilic and mesophilic species have similar mechanisms of adaptations to the action of antibiotic compounds [44,45].The coincubation of a bacterial cell with an antimicrobial peptide causes a cellular response to the action of the drug, which is demonstrated in suppressing the growth and changing the vital activity of the cell [46]. Cells often react with changes in the quantitative and qualitative composition of synthesized proteins in response to stress caused by the action of an antimicrobial peptide [47,48]. Differential protein expression analysis is a method that allows the identification of the differences between the proteins synthesized by the cell in the control and in the experiment with the tested effector on protein expression [49,50]. HPLC-MS is a technique that is widely used for the proteomics of complex mixtures of proteins and peptides. Of course, studies of the transcriptome can also provide interesting quantitative information about changes in cellular processes under the influence of the effector [51]. However, as noted in the works [52,53], it is often difficult to establish a correlation between the level of expression of mRNA and protein in the cell. In addition, due to the fact that the considered active antimicrobial substance R23I is a peptide acting according to the proposed mechanism based on directed peptide\u2013protein aggregation, we focused directly on the analysis of the proteins and not the RNA. The peptide and proteins, the synthesis of which is indirectly influenced by this peptide, can be analogs of the effectors and components of the bacterial response to the antimicrobial peptide [54,55,56,57].In our earlier work, we described the change in the growth of the bacterial culture ofT. thermophilus, its proteome, and cell morphology under the action of the R23I peptide [23]. In this article, we focus not only on the inhibitory concentrations of the peptide but also on the concentrations that did not impact on the grow bacteria. R23I is an amyloidogenic peptide synthesized based on the S1 ribosomal protein sequence. We assume that the peptide with an amyloidogenic ability interacts with a cellular target by the mechanism of directed coaggregation (Figure 1). This hypothetical mechanism was described earlier [58]. At the moment, the reason for the death of bacterial cells treated with the R23I peptide remains unclear. The study of the cell proteome using mass spectrometry can expand our understanding of the bacterial stress responses caused by AMP activity. Thus, the aim of this work was to identify proteins whose expression is altered by the action of the amyloid-antimicrobial peptide of inhibitory and non-inhibitory concentrations.2. Results and Discussion2.1. Changes in Protein Profiles after R23I Peptide TreatmentThe R23I peptide inhibits the growth ofT. thermophiluscell culture at concentrations above 40 \u03bcg/mL, as shown inFigure 2, with a concentration of 20 \u03bcg/mL being the highest concentration that does not inhibit the bacterial cells\u2019 growth.T. thermophilusbacteria were treated with the amyloidogenic antibacterial peptide R23I during one day at one subinhibitory and two inhibitory dosages (20, 50, and 100 \u03bcg/mL, respectively). The resulting cells were disrupted, and proteins were isolated from them and then analyzed by chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry. We identified a total of 269,814 peptides across the three dosages and control. Of the identified peptides, 7279 were unique, resulting in 1070 proteins identified. That is, approximately half of the proteins known from the UniProt database were identified. Moreover, this result is slightly better than that obtained using MALDI-TOF-MS [59]. Furthermore, 291 proteins were present in all samples and were used for principal component analysis (PCA) (Figure 3A), which showed that the treatment groups were well separated from the controls. Regarding the dosages, the proteins with 20 \u03bcg/mL dosage formed a distinct cluster in the PCA plot, while the proteins with 50 and 100 \u03bcg/mL dosage seemed to form one group, suggesting that the protein abundance differed between the subinhibitory and inhibitory conditions.Changes in the proteome were identified by calculating the fold change (FC) in protein abundance relative to the control condition. The significance of each observed fold change was determined by calculatingpvalues. An FC\u2009 \u2265 \u20091.2 and an adjustedpvalue\u2009\u2264 0.05 were defined as the biological and statistical cutoff values, respectively. As the result, 82 proteins had significantly different abundances: 15 were upregulated and 67 were downregulated (Figure 3B). The protein with the highest FC was Q72JI4, an aminopeptidase involved in catalytic activity (seeSupplementary File S1). The protein with the lowest FC had Q72J15, a leucine-, isoleucine-, valine-, threonine-, and alanine-binding protein involved in amino acid transport. Strikingly, a quarter of the revealed proteins (19 out of 82) were 30S and 50S ribosomal proteins, and all of them were downregulated according to the volcano plot ({S2 S4 S9 S11 S12 S15 S16 S18 S19} and {L2 L5 L13 L14 L15 L22 L23 L24 L27 L29} (Figure 3B andFigure 4).At the same time, the proteins S2, S4, and S15 belong to the protein regulators of the small ribosomal subunit [24]. The S2 operon (rpsB\u2013tsf operon) of the bacteria encodes the elongation factor Ts and S2 protein, which was also downregulated in our case. S4, together with protein S7, initiates the assembly of the 30S ribosomal subunit [60]. Thus, our data align with the extensive research on the effects of ribosomal protein S1 inactivation and its consequences [24]. Unlike the work of S\u00f8rensen et al. [24], in which this effect was studied by deleting the rpsA gene encoding S1 inE. coli, our study inactivated the S1 protein through its targeted coaggregation with the R23I peptide.An interesting pattern was observed in the comparison between groups (Figure 3C). Some proteins were upregulated in the dose 20 group, while they were downregulated in the dose 50 \u03bcg/mL and 100 \u03bcg/mL groups, in particular, heat shock protein, oxidoreductase, and chaperone protein, suggesting that, at a subinhibitory dose, the bacteria could mobilize resources to overcome the damage and that, at inhibitory doses, these resources were depleted.As demonstrated inFigure 3A, the samples revealed distinct clustering of the control and 20 \u03bcg/mL groups, while the 50 and 100 \u03bcg/mL groups clustered together. This suggests that the proteomic response differs between the subinhibitory and inhibitory concentrations of the peptide. As a rule, the subinhibitory concentrations of stress factors induce changes in specific regulatory proteins without clearly affecting the overall protein levels [61]. Additionally, the volcano plot inFigure 3B further emphasizes proteins with statistically significant differential abundance between the control and treatment groups. This analysis allows us to pinpoint which proteins are most affected by the peptide treatment, either by being upregulated or downregulated.Figure 3B,C present 82 differentially regulated and statistically significant proteins. Thus, out of the 1070 identified proteins, these 82 were selected for further analysis. Previous studies have also reported a relatively small number of proteins, among the total identified, that were differentially regulated under the influence of antimicrobial peptides [62,63]. This can be explained by the fact that antimicrobial peptides do not affect all cellular processes but act through specific mechanisms, typically targeting particular cellular components and functions [64,65].2.2. Comparison of Proteomic Analysis Results Obtained Using the Proteomics Tools PEAKS and IdentiPyThe results of the presented proteomic analysis can be compared with the previously published results on the number of proteins [23]. Both programs found approximately 250\u2013300 proteins common to the four groups (PEAKS\u2014291 proteins, IdentiPy\u2014257), with an intersection of 155 proteins, which is more than half of each set. However, if we examine the proteins that were identified as significantly different by groups as a result of statistical processing (Figure 5A), we see that the number of proteins common to the two programs was only 33. This is less than half of the protein sets identified as significantly different (PEAKS\u201482 proteins, IdentiPy\u201491). This suggests that the results of chromatogram processing by the search program can significantly affect the results of further analysis.It should be noted that, in the previous work, mass spectrometry data analysis was conducted using earlier versions of the software, namely Peaks Studio 7.5 and IdentiPy [66], whereas, in the present study, PEAKS Studio 11 was used for these purposes. Additionally, integration with deep learning-based technology allows PEAKS Studio 11 to utilize the predicted retention time as another validation level to resolve ambiguity between peptides with similar ion matching scores [67]. Differences between software programs lead to variations in the identified proteins. Specifically, PEAKS Studio 11, utilized in this study, identified a greater number of peptides and consequently detected more proteins than the 2018 version of IdentiPy used in the previous study. Thus, the results obtained in this study facilitate the comparison of different software tools for mass spectrometry data analysis.2.3. The Analysis and Description of Changes in the Relative Amount of Proteins in Terms of Gene OntologyIn addition to the targeted analysis of differentially expressed proteins, gene ontology (GO) term overrepresentation and pathway enrichment analyses were performed to identify changes in biological functions (Figure 6). The GO location analysis pointed out that most proteins were decreased in the ribosome, followed by the cytoplasm and membrane, while an increased level was equally seen in the cytoplasm and membrane, although in lesser number (Figure 6A). The GO function demonstrated that proteins with decreased levels were mainly associated with the structural constituent of the ribosome, rRNA and nucleotide binding, and oxidoreductase activity; proteins with increased levels were mainly associated with metal ion binding and transferase activity (Figure 6B). Of interest, few proteins involved in lipid binding (degV protein, Q72K34) and the sulfur (sulfur carrier protein TtuD, Q72JV2) pathway were upregulated. The GO processes showed that proteins with decreased levels were mainly associated with translation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, proteolysis, and transport (Figure 6C). Despite the fact that increased proteins were also involved in proteolysis and transport, some unique terms were observed, namely, cell wall organization and lipid A and peptidoglycan biosynthetic processes. It appears that, in a state of severely compromised protein synthesis, the bacteria made an effort to allocate their remaining resources to maintaining the cell wall. We could speculate that R23I has some impact not only on ribosomes but on the membrane as well.Some AMPs (for example, human antibacterial peptide LL-37) have been shown to induce oxidative stress inEscherichia coli,disrupting the flow of electrons through the electron transport chain [54]. For this relative quantitative indicator, a decrease in the content of the S-layer membrane protein was noted. Of note, Kirk et al. recently identified Clostridium difficile strains that were not susceptible to bacteriocins (a class of AMPs) due to the lack of a surface S-layer [55]. The decrease in the concentration of the S-layer protein ofT. thermophilusis directly related to the adaptation mechanism to the action of the R23I peptide. Moreover, with an increase in the concentration of the R23I peptide, a decrease in the relative concentration of the S-layer protein was observed. Notably, the S-layer protein has important roles in survival, adhesion, and pathogenesis [68]. The protein is able to perform protein secretion and antibiotic export [69]. However, other authors show that S-layer proteins combined with antibiotics can inhibit bacterial growth [70]. It remains unclear whether the decrease in the content of S-layer proteins is associated with the antimicrobial effect of R23I. Similar dynamics were observed for other membrane proteins (Figure 7).Protection of the bacterial population from the limiting factor through the mechanism of persistent formation. It is known that persisters have a low level of expression of tricarboxylic acid cycle genes [71]. In our work, we also described a decrease in the expression of genes of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, including malate dehydrogenase and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (succinyl-transferring). This decrease may indicate an imbalance in energy processes, which could lead to cell death.It was shown that the regulation of gene expression can be carried out both by the holo-enzyme and by subunits [72]. Mutations of the bacterial RNA polymerase can lead to changes in the physiology and virulence of bacterial cells [73]. We also observed changes in the profiles of ribosomal protein abundance. Probably, the changes are the result of the R23I peptide interaction through the mechanism of directed coaggregation.Changes in the abundance of enzymes in the Krebs cycle (fumarate hydratase class II (Fumarase C) and succinate\u2014CoA ligase [ADP-forming] subunit beta; oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (succinyl-transferring) and isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP (+)); malate synthase; succinate dehydrogenase iron\u2013sulfur subunit, citrate synthase, aconitate hydratase (aconitase) and succinate dehydrogenase flavoprotein subunit) can be the result of \u201ctuning\u201d the catabolic pathway in response to increased energy demands [71].In our prior research, we demonstrated that peptide R23I has the potential to induce substantial changes in the proteome, influencing a multitude of proteins crucial to essential cellular functions [23]. Notably, proteins such as cytochrome c oxidase subunit 2, isocitrate dehydrogenase (NADP), and NADH-quinone oxidoreductase subunit 2 were affected, suggesting a decrease in ATP and NADP synthesis. This observation provides support for the theory proposing a decline in metabolic activity in response to peptide-induced stress.Moving forward, we plan to investigate the time-dependent effects of the R23I peptide and its analogs [28,74] on the proteomes of pathogenic bacteria such asStaphylococcus aureusandPseudomonas aeruginosa. This further research aims to enhance our understanding of how antimicrobial peptides interact with pathogenic bacterial cells and how they influence proteome changes. Studying changes in the bacterial proteome after different incubation periods with the peptide will help determine whether the peptide\u2019s effects are immediate and direct or delayed and indirect.3. Materials and Methods3.1. Experimental Design and Sample Preparation for MS/MS AnalysisIn previous studies, we found that the R23I peptide exhibits antibacterial activity in the concentration range of 50\u2013500 \u03bcg/mL [23]. In this work, we used concentrations of 20, 50, and 100 \u03bcg/mL. Experimental samples were taken in three technical repetitions, and the control samples (T. thermophiluscells without R23I peptide) underwent two technical repetitions.The cells of the control sample and with the addition of different concentrations of the peptide were incubated for 24 h at the temperature of 70 \u00b0C in 1.5 mL tubes in an ES-20/60 shaker-incubator (Biosan, R\u012bga, Latvia). The optical density of the cell culture was measured at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer SF-102 (Akvilon, Moscow, Russia). The cell suspension was destroyed by freezing and thawing for 5 cycles. Cell lysates were concentrated using an Eppendorf 5301 vacuum concentrator (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Then, the electrophoretic separation of proteins in PAGE was carried out according to the Laemmli method [75]. A sample buffer was added to homogenized samples and loaded onto a 12% polyacrylamide gel in the presence of SDS. The buffer consisted of 1.25 mL 0.5 M Tris-HCl, 2.5 mL 50% glycerol, 1 mL 10% SDS, 0.2 mL 0.5% bromophenol blue, and 3.55 mL deionized H2O. The separation was carried out in two modes. First at 80\u201390 V before entering the separating gel, then at 180 V. The standard procedure for staining and washing the gels from Coomassie was used.In-gel digestion was carried out according to the standard procedure [76]. High-molecular-weight, medium-molecular-weight, and low-molecular-weight fractions were cut out of the gel with a scalpel and placed into 1.5 mL tubes. To remove SDS, 1 mL of a mixture of 40% methanol and 5% acetic acid was added in tubes and then incubated at room temperature for 15 min. The gel was washed from the dye with 1 mL of a solution of 50% acetonitrile in 50 mM NH4HCO3(pH 8.0) for 20 min at 56 \u00b0C. To reduce disulfide bonds, the samples were incubated for 30 min at 36 \u00b0C with 50 \u03bcL of a 5 mM solution of \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. For subsequent alkylation, the samples were incubated with 50 \u03bcL of a 15 mM iodoacetamide solution for 30 min in the dark at room temperature. After each step, the gel fragments were washed with deionized water. Dehydration of the samples was carried out by adding 1 mL of acetonitrile for 10 min, followed by vacuum concentration.Enzymatic hydrolysis was carried out by incubating the sample with a trypsin solution (10 \u03bcg/mL trypsin in 200 \u03bcL 50 mM NH4HCO3) for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Then, the solution was removed, and 400 \u03bcL of 50 mM NH4HCO3was added. The samples were incubated in a thermal shaker for 20 h at 37 \u00b0C, and then the solution was transferred into clean tubes and dried on a vacuum concentrator. Subsequently, 100 \u03bcL of a mixture of 80% acetonitrile and 0.1% TFA was added to the gel for the additional extraction of peptides and incubated for 30 min at 25 \u00b0C. The protein hydrolysate was dried for analysis. Before mass spectrometric analysis, the peptide fractions were pooled and then purified using a ZipTip Empore octadecyl C18.3.2. Liquid Chromatography\u2013Mass Spectrometry (LC-ESI-Orbitrap)Chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (analysis) was carried out on an Orbitrap Elite ETD mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) coupled with an EASY nLC 1000 nano-flow chromatograph (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).The mixture of peptides was separated on C18 reversed-phase columns packed in laboratory conditions (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) with the following parameters: pore size 100 \u00c5, particle size 1.7 \u03bcm, column length 150\u2013200 mm, and column inner diameter 100 \u03bcm. For the concentration and additional purification of the samples, we used a Precolumn C18 PepMap 100 (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with the following parameters: pore size 100 \u00c5, particle size 5 \u00b5m, column length 5 mm, and column inner diameter 300 \u00b5m.The elution of peptides was carried out in a concentration gradient of acetonitrile from 5% to 50% at a flow rate of 300 nL/min for 240 min. The loaded volume (of the sample) was 1\u201310 \u03bcL. The ionization of the sample molecules was carried out by the nano-electrospray method. The voltage applied to the emitter was varied from 1800 to 2000 V. The temperature at the inlet capillary was 200 \u00b0C. The fragmentation of the selected ions was activated by collisions with molecules of an inert gas (helium) in a high-energy chamber (HCD method). The selection of ions for fragmentation was carried out automatically.3.3. Data AnalysisThe raw mass spectrometry data were mapped to the proteome database from Thermus thermophilus (Uniport, strain ATCC BAA-163/DSM 7039/HB27, Tax ID: 262724, May 2023) using PEAKS Studio 11 (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Waterloo, ON, Canada), allowing for 20 ppm parent ion and 0.02m/zfragment ion mass error, 2 missed cleavages, carbamidomethylation, and oxidation (M) as fixed modifications. To limit false-positive peptide identification, a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) was applied to peptide spectrum matches (PSMs), and subsequently, the identified peptides were filtered with \u22652 unique peptides in all biological replicates. Label-free quantitative analysis was carried out on the identified peptides by using such a module in the PEAKS Studio 11 (Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Waterloo, ON, Canada). The peak areas were normalized to the total ion count (TIC) of the respective analysis run before performing pairwise comparison between the groups. The protein abundance ratio between the control and treatment conditions was filtered with fold change ratios\u2009of \u22651.2, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to test the statistical significance of the observed abundance changes, withpvalues below 0.05 considered to be statistically significant. The mean protein coverage for each condition was used for the heatmap of ribosomal proteins. The Z-scores were calculated for the rows, and the hierarchically clustered graph was built in the Python 3.10.14 Seaborn module. The heatmaps inFigure 3C andFigure 6and the Venn diagrams inFigure 7were visualized using the Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn libraries of Python, based on data from PEAKS Studio 11. The log2 ratio values were calculated from the ratios of the abundance of each group relative to the average protein abundance across all groups. The gene ontology (GO) term overrepresentation and pathway enrichment analyses of differentially expressed proteins was based on annotation taken from the GO webpage (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/(accessed on 13 September 2024)).4. ConclusionsThe protein abundance profile was shown to vary with the concentration of the R23I peptide. In total, 82 differentially expressed proteins were identified compared with controls and other samples (as determined by the volcano plot), of which 15 were upregulated and 67 were downregulated. The dynamics of protein expression is probably associated with compensatory changes due to the action of the peptide. Changes relative to the quantity of proteins under the action of R23I at a concentration of 20, 50, and 100 \u03bcg/mL are related to the membrane and cytoplasmic proteins that are associated with processes such as transcription, translation, and energy conversion. It has been demonstrated that the cell response ofT. thermophilusto the action of the R23I peptide can be correlated with that of other pathogenic and non-pathogenic model organisms.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded athttps://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/bacteria3040020/s1, File S1: Names of proteins with different expression.Author ContributionsConceptualization, A.K.S. and O.V.G.; methodology, A.K.S.; software, A.I.M., M.V.S., and A.P.K.; validation, A.K.S., A.I.M., M.V.S., A.P.K.; M.Y.S., V.E.B., S.Y.G., and O.V.G.; formal analysis, A.K.S., A.I.M., M.V.S., A.P.K.; M.Y.S., V.E.B., S.Y.G., and O.V.G.; investigation, A.K.S., A.I.M., M.V.S., A.P.K.; M.Y.S., V.E.B., S.Y.G., and O.V.G.; resources, A.K.S.; data curation, A.K.S. and O.V.G.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.K.S., A.I.M., M.V.S., A.P.K.; M.Y.S., V.E.B., S.Y.G., and O.V.G.; writing\u2014review and editing, O.V.G.; visualization, A.I.M. and S.Y.G.; supervision, A.K.S. and O.V.G.; project administration, A.K.S. and O.V.G.; funding acquisition, O.V.G.

        "abstract": "Carao (Cassia grandis) contains numerous bioactive substances that contribute to gastrointestinal well-being. The present study assessed the potential impacts of carao on the viability and performance of Streptococcus thermophilus and Lactobacillus bulgaricus under various adverse conditions. These conditions included bile, acid, gastric juice, and lysozyme exposure, simulating the digestive process from the mouth to the intestines. The activity of proteases from cultures was monitored to examine their proteolytic capabilities. To achieve this, the cultures were cultivated in a solution containing plant material, and the results were compared against a control sample after an incubation period. Subsequently, the total phenolic content, total carotenoid content, antioxidant activity, sugar profile, and acid profile of the plant materials were analyzed. These analyses were conducted to explore these compounds\u2019 influence on cultures\u2019 survival. Seeds contained the highest total phenols (766.87 \u00b1 11.56 \u00b5g GAE/mL), total carotenoid content (7.43 \u00b1 0.31 mg Q/mL), and antioxidant activity (40.76 \u00b1 1.87%). Pulp contained the highest moisture (12.55 \u00b1 0.44%), ash (6.45 \u00b1 0.15%), lipid (0.66 \u00b1 0.07%), protein (16.56 \u00b1 0.21%), sucrose (9.07 \u00b1 0.78 g/100 g), and fructose (3.76 \u00b1 0.06 g/ 100 g). The crust had the highest content of ash (85.14 \u00b1 0.27%) and succinic acid (2.01 \u00b1 0.06 g/100 g). Results indicated that seeds negatively affected cultures\u2019 survival in the bile tolerance test and had positive effects on Lactobacillus bulgaricus in the protease activity test. Otherwise, the other carao tissues could not change the results significantly (p > 0.05) compared to the control in different tests. The carao crust positively affected cultures\u2019 against protease activity, especially in Lactobacillus bulgaricus, and had a negative effect on the growth of S. thermophilus in the lysozyme and gastric acid resistance test.",

        "content": "1. IntroductionThe FAO/WHO defines probiotics as \u201clive microorganisms that, when administered in sufficient quantities, provide a positive impact on the well-being of the host.\u201d Various health effects have been linked to lactic acid bacteria, and these effects have differing levels of supporting evidence. The positive effect of probiotics depends on the bacterial strain and the quantity used, and each individual probiotic must validate its benefits through laboratory tests, animal trials (when applicable), and human research as stipulated by the FAO/WHO. Concurrently, the appropriate dosage of probiotics is reliant on the strain and product to ensure survival and colonization in the intestine [1].Owing to the increasing public awareness regarding the benefits of lactic acid bacteria for health, maintaining intestinal microbial balance, and reinforcing mucosal defenses against pathogens, there is a rapid surge in demand for functional foods containing microorganisms possessing lactic acid bacteria attributes. Lactic acid bacteria encompass beneficial bacteria that offer therapeutic advantages to the host organisms ingesting them. Probiotic products comprise live microorganisms at levels surpassing 106to 107CFU/mL, aiming to elicit a favorable influence on human health, and demonstrate resilience in the demanding conditions within the human digestive tract [2].Many lactic acid bacteria can provide immune boosts, inflammation alleviation, alleviation of gastrointestinal distress, and prevention of diarrhea. These outcomes are achieved through a range of mechanisms, such as generating antimicrobial substances like organic acids and bacteriocins, regulating the immune response through the secretion of immunoglobulin A (IgA) to counter potential pathogens, reducing the likelihood of allergy development, strengthening the function of the intestinal mucosal barrier, aiding in the restoration of disrupted commensal microflora, adjusting the expression of host genes, and releasing functional proteins [3].Dairy products represent the probiotic foods that are most widely accessible in the market. This success is attributed to the fact that milk is a natural and integral element of a well-rounded diet. Most foods containing probiotic microorganisms are dairy products that have undergone fermentation. This category encompasses yogurt, fermented milk and whey beverages, kefir, fermented sour cream, buttermilk, and various types of cheeses. These food products are well suited for incorporating probiotics due to their existing favorable consumer perception and their compatibility with current production methods, requiring minimal adjustments. Fruits and other plant-derived products have the potential to serve as effective substrates for probiotics, given their content of vitamins, minerals, fiber, carbohydrates, and antioxidant elements [4]. Recently, the probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria were examined concerning new food sources such as weevil (Rhynchophorus palmarum), nipple fruit (Solanum mammosum), teosinte (Dioon mejiae), and Caesar mushroom (Amanita caesarea) [5,6,7,8,9]. Carao has been used in yogurt and it shows great antioxidant and hypoglycemic potential [10]. Furthermore, these food items do not contain common allergens found in milk-based products, which could help avoid intake limitations. Within this context, fruit-based probiotic products present an intriguing area for research, particularly due to their ability to endure acidic conditions. It is also essential for probiotics to be administered through food matrices that are acceptable to consumers [9].Carao is a large, bushy tree with dark green foliage and pink flowers in bunches and is very showy. The fruit has a cylindrical shape measuring more than half a yard long and is full of crushed seeds [10]. Carao (Cassia grandis) contains numerous bioactive substances that contribute to gastrointestinal well-being. The flesh contains abundant carotenoid levels, while the seeds exhibit a significant presence of phenolic compounds and strong antioxidant properties. Among the trace minerals, magnesium, calcium, iron, and manganese are found in substantial quantities. There is a proposal for the utilization of carao in nutritional, pharmaceutical, and medicinal contexts [10,11,12].L. bulgaricusandS. thermophilusare commonly employed together as starter cultures in the production of diverse dairy products. Their cooperative interaction involves metabolite exchange, known as protocooperation, which fosters the growth of both strains.L. bulgaricusproduces PrtB, an external protease that decomposes milk proteins, serving as a nitrogen source for itself andS. thermophilus. Conversely,S. thermophiluscontributes acids like formic acid and folic acid, alongside carbon dioxide, to benefitL. bulgaricus. Furthermore,S. thermophilusmanufactures specific amino acids and expresses a cell envelope proteinase (PrtS). This symbiotic relationship enhances the acidification of milk and the overall proliferation of microorganisms [13,14].Prebiotics are generally found in different food sources, such as plant materials. As a result, the primary objective of this study is to examine how carao enhancesStreptococcus thermophilusandLactobacillus bulgaricuscharacteristics throughout the digestive tract, spanning from the mouth to the intestines. As carao has significant amounts of bioactive compounds, it was worth examining carao\u2019s prebiotic properties in yogurt starter culture. Various tests were conducted to assess the impact of carao peel, seeds, and pulp on the cultures\u2019 growth.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Plant MaterialBetween May and June 2021, the carao fruit was collected within the Guapinol Biological Reserve, located in the Marcovia Municipality of the Choluteca Department in Honduras. The carao peel, seeds, and pulp were manually separated and subsequently combined with water (10% w/w). The mixture was then frozen and stored at a temperature of \u221280 \u00b0C until the plant material was subjected to lyophilization using the LIOTOP model L 101. The solution obtained was subjected to lyophilization under conditions of \u221273 to \u221276 \u00b0C and 0.1\u20130.3 Pa for a duration of 48 h. The resulting lyophilized pulp was then processed into powder form using a commercial mill (LABOR model SP31). Finally, the powdered pulp was vacuum-sealed in plastic bags [7].2.2. Experimental DesignFour gentle stressors (including acid exposure, bile exposure, lysozyme exposure, and exposure to gastric juices) were assessed in cultures ofStreptococcus thermophilusST-M5 andLactobacillus bulgaricusLB-12 (obtained from Chr. Hansen, Milwaukee, WI, USA) individually. Carao seeds, carao pulp, and carao crust were studied at a concentration of 2% [7]. Each assessment was subjected to a series of stressors: exposure to low pH (pH 2), exposure to oxgall salt (0.3%), exposure to lysozyme (100 mg/L), and exposure to gastric juice containing pepsin (0.32%) and NaCl (0.2%). A control group was also included without the ingredient being tested. The tests encompassed viability evaluation, lysozyme resistance assessment, and tolerance to gastric juices. These aspects were quantified by performing plate counts. The enumeration of test counts was carried out on MRS agar (forLactobacillus bulgaricus) and M17 agar (forStreptococcus thermophilus) at different time intervals. The experimentation was replicated thrice, with duplicate readings obtained each time. Additionally, carao seeds, crust, and pulp were subjected to further analysis, encompassing antioxidant capacity, total phenolic content, total carotenoid content, total sugar content, and organic acid content.2.3. Proximate Analysis of Plant MaterialMoisture content (method 935.29), fat (method 954.02), ash (method 923.03), and proteins (method 991.20) were determined according to the AOAC. The total carbohydrate content was calculated by difference and the calorie content was calculated by the Atwater coefficient. Analyses were repeated twice, and each analysis was undertaken in triplicate [15].2.4. Radical-Scavenging Activity Assay and Total Polyphenol ContentFreshly harvested plant tissues (including carao seeds, crust, and pulp) were freeze-dried at a temperature of \u221265 \u00b0C for 72 h. The resulting freeze-dried plant materials were finely crushed using a mortar and pestle. Approximately 100 mg of the finely powdered substance, with a precision level of \u00b1 0.5 mg, was accurately measured and placed into a 15 mL centrifuge tube. For the extraction procedure, a mixture of 80% methanol (10 mL) was used as the solvent. The mixture was vigorously mixed for one minute using a vortex mixer and then subjected to sonication for fifteen min, pausing vortexing for one minute after every five minutes of sonication. Following this, the mixture was centrifuged for 5 min at 1230 g force. The resulting liquid supernatant was collected and utilized for the determination of total phenolics and total antioxidant content. The TPC (total phenolic content) was measured using a customized version of the Folin\u2013Ciocalteu (FC) method [16]. Precisely 0.5 mL of the liquid supernatant was carefully added to a 25 mL test tube and combined with 8 mL of ultrapure water from the Barnstead MP-12A source in Haverhill, MA. Following this step, 0.5 mL of the Folin\u2013Ciocalteu reagent was introduced into the mixture. After a 3 min interval, 1 mL of a 1 N solution of sodium bicarbonate (Na2CO3) was incorporated, and the resulting solution was allowed to remain undisturbed for a duration of 2 h at room temperature, approximately 22 \u00b0C. The absorbance of the resultant solution was assessed at 750 nm employing a Lambda 35 UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Instruments, Norwalk, CT). Gallic acid was utilized as the reference standard [16]. A calibration curve was constructed using gallic acid within a concentration range of 50 to 300 \u00b5g/mL. The total phenolic content was quantified and reported as milligrams of gallic acid equivalent per gram of dry weight (mg GAE/g). The antioxidant activity was measured according to the method developed by Brand-Williams et al. (1995) [17], with slight modifications. DPPH (1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydazyl) was used as the source of free radicals [18]. The absorbance of free radicals at 517 nm disappears upon their reduction by an antioxidant. In this study, Trolox (6-hydroxy-2, 5, 7, 8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid) was used as the standard antioxidant compound. Exactly 0.1 mL of extract was diluted with an additional 0.4 mL of 80% methanol and added to a 1.5 mL amber-colored centrifuge tube containing 0.5 mL of freshly prepared 80% methanol solution of DPPH (0.01577 g/100 mL). The resultant mixture was shaken in the dark for 2 min and then incubated for 30 min at room temperature in darkness. The percent inhibition of DPPH was calculated from the decrease in absorbance using Equation (1).I% = [(Blank Absorbance \u2212 sample absorbance V)/(Blank Absorbance) \u00d7 100(1)The decrease in DPPH absorbance was measured at 517 nm using a Lambda 35 UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Perkin Elmer Instruments, Norwalk, CT, USA). The extract was replaced with 80% methanol in the control sample. A solution of 80% methanol without DPPH was used as the blank. The antioxidant activity was calculated from a standard curve made with known concentrations of Trolox [17].2.5. Total Carotenoid ContentConventional extraction of carotenoids and their esters from the freeze-dried carao tissues (seeds, pulp, and peel) was performed according to the procedure reported by Cano et al. (2019) [19] with some modifications. First, 1 g of the freeze-dried sample was mixed with 0.5 g magnesium carbonate and 50 \u03bcL of (all-E)-\u03b2-apo-8\u2032-carotenal (0.40 mg/mL), as an internal standard. Then, 20 mL of tetrahydrofuran (THF) stabilized with 0.1% (w/v) of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) was added for the extraction. The sample was homogenized in an Omnimixer (OMNI Macro S\u00ae, OMNI International, Kennesaw, GA, USA) at 3000 g for 3 min and placed in an ultrasonic water bath (3000514 model, 50/60 Hz, 360 W, J.P. Selecta S.A., Barcelona, Spain) for 30 min. The extract was centrifuged at 15,000\u00d7gfor 10 min at 4 \u00b0C and the supernatant was collected. Subsequently, 20 mL of acetone was added to the pellet and the sample was extracted again. Re-extraction of the recovered solids was carried out 3 times until a colorless residue was obtained. Supernatants were combined in the same separation funnel, where 20 mL of diethyl ether was added; when an emulsion was formed, 20 mL of saturated water with 30% (w/v) NaCl was added. The organic phase was collected and dried with 2.5 g of anhydrous sodium sulfate over 10 min at room temperature. The sample was filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper and the filtrate obtained was transferred to a round amber flask and vacuum-dried in a rotatory evaporator at 30 \u00b0C. Finally, the extract was dissolved to 2 mL with MeOH/MTBE/H2O (45.5:52.5:2,v/v/v) and filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm filter. All procedures were carried out at room temperature and in dim light to avoid carotenoid isomerization and degradation. Total carotenoid content was determined spectrophotometrically at 450 nm using a UV\u2013Vis spectrophotometer (Specord 210 Plus, Analytik Jena). After the carotenoid extraction procedure, the volume of the carotenoid oil extracts was noted, and the absorbance was measured against absolute hexane used as a blank. Hexane solutions were analyzed under diminished light. Total carotenoid content (\u03bcg carotenoids/g vegetable oil) was calculated according to Equation (2).Total carotenoid content (\u03bcg/g) = [(A \u00d7 V)/(E1%1cm \u00d7 P \u00d7100)] \u00d7 106(2)where A is the absorbance at 450 nm, V is the total volume of dissolution (mL), E1%1 cm is the extinction coefficient of the mixture of carotenoids in hexane (\u03be = 2500 dL/g cm, according to Melendez-Martinez et al., 2007 [20]), and P is the plant tissue extract weight (g).2.6. HPLC Determination of Sugars and Organic AcidsFor plant tissue extract preparation, 10 g of plant tissue powder was homogenized in 80% ethanol for 1 min at high speed using a Virtis 45 homogenizer [21]. The resulting slurry was immediately boiled for 15 min, cooled, and filtered through Whatman #4 paper; the residue and original container were washed with additional 80% ethanol and made up to a final volume of 100 mL. About 5 mL was filtered through a 0.45~ filter membrane before injecting into the HPLC. For sugar standard preparation, a 1% standard of any sugar (fructose, maltose, glucose, and sucrose) was prepared as 1 g of analytical-grade sugar (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) was homogenized in 80% ethanol, boiled, filtered, made up to 100 mL with 80% ethanol and filtered before injecting into the HPLC. For the determination of sugars, a Beckman series 340 liquid chromatograph equipped with a model 112 pump, a model 210 injector fitted with a 20 /IL sample loop, and a model 156 refractive index detector were used. The detector signal was electronically integrated by a Varian 401 integrator in the external standard mode using an attenuation of 16 and a chart speed of 0.5 cm/min. Sugars were separated with a 300 mm \u00d7 7.8 mm id. Column packed with Aminex HPX-87C resin (Bio-Rad Labs, Richmond, CA, USA) heated to 75 \u00b0C. The following were plumbed between the injector and the analytical column, respectively: a 2~ Rhea-dyne 7302 column inlet filter; a 40 \u00d7 4.6 mm ion exclusion guard cartridge packed with Aminex HPX-85H resin (Bio-Rad Labs, Richmond, CA, USA); and a 40 \u00d7 4.6 mm anion/OH guard cartridge packed with Aminex A-25 resin (Bio-Rad Labs, Richmond, CA, USA). The mobile phase was degassed HPLC-grade Hz0 at a flow rate of 1.2 mL/min [21].For organic acid standard preparation, a 0.5% standard of any organic acid (citric, tartaric, L-Malic, quinic, and succinic acids) was used. A 0.500 g amount of analytical-grade organic acid (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) was homogenized in 80% ethanol, boiled, filtered, made up to 100 mL with 80% ethanol, and ultrafiltered before injecting into the HPLC. Organic acids were not affected by heating, as checked against unboiled standards dissolved in 80% ethanol. For organic acid determination, a Beckman series 340 liquid chromatograph (Beckman Instruments, Inc., Berkely, CA, USA) equipped with a model 112 pump, model 210 injector fitted with a 20 L sample loop, and a model 160 ultraviolet detector at a fixed wavelength was used after 214 nm. The detector was set at 0.100 AU and the peak area of the signal was electronically integrated by a Vista 401 integrator (Var\u00edan Assoc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) in the external standard mode by using an attenuation of 4 and a chart speed of 0.5 cm/min. Organic acids were separated with a 300 mm \u00d7 7.8 mm i.d. Aminex HPX-87H column (BioRad Laboratories, Richmond, CA, USA). The column temperature was maintained at 75 \u00b0C with an SSI column heater (Scientific Systems, State College, PA, USA). Plumbed between the injector and the analytical column were, respectively, a 2-pm filter Rheodyne Model 7302 column inlet (Rheodyne, Cotati, CA, USA) and a 40 \u00d7 4.6 mm ion exclusion guard cartridge packed with Aminex HPX-85H resin (Bio-Rad Laboratories). The mobile phase was degassed 0.0008 N H2S04 made by diluting reagent-grade concentrated sulfuric acid in HPLC-grade water. The flow rate was 0.8 mL/ min [22].Exactly 10.00 g (sufficient for adequate resolution of organic acids with the HPLC system described below) of randomly selected tissue was homogenized in 80% ethanol to ensure rapid enzyme denaturation for 1 min at high speed with a Virtis 45 homogenizer. The resulting slurry was immediately boiled for 15 min, cooled, and filtered through Whatman #4 paper; the residue and original container were washed with additional 80% ethanol and made up to a final volume of 100 mL [22].2.7. Bile Tolerance TestThe bile tolerance ofS. thermophilusandL. bulgaricuswas determined by the method of Perei and Gibson (2002) [19] with some modifications. Yogurt\u2019s stater cultures were evaluated for their ability to grow in MRS broth (Criterion\u2122, Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA, USA) and M17 broth (Criterion\u2122, Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA, USA), respectively, supplemented with 0.2% (wt/v) of sodium thioglycolate (Acros Organics, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA) and bile salt oxagall (0.3wt/vol). Sodium thioglycolate was only used in MRS broth as an oxygen scavenger to achieve microaerophilic conditions. Starter cultures were inoculated (10% [v/v]) into MRS broth or M17 broth with 0.3% (wt/v) oxgall (bovine bile) (US Biological, Swampscott, MA, USA) and incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 \u00b0C and anaerobically at 43 \u00b0C for 8 h (measured hourly) [9,23].2.8. Acid Tolerance TestThe acid tolerance ofS. thermophilusandL. bulgaricuswas determined by the method of Perei and Gibson (2002) [23] with some modifications. Starter cultures were inoculated (10% [v/v]) into acidified MRS broth (Criterion\u2122, Hardy Diagnostics, Santa Maria, CA, USA) earlier adjusted to pH 2.0 with 1N HCl. The acidified MRS broth with cultures was incubated in a water bath at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min. One-milliliter samples were taken at various times (0, 30, 60, and 120 min), serially 10-fold diluted in peptone water, and plated in duplicate onto MRS agar (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA) and M17 Agar (Difco, Detroit, MI, USA), respectively.2.9. Tolerance to Simulated Gastric JuiceTolerance ofS. thermophilusandL. bulgaricuswith the functional ingredients to simulated gastric juice (SGJ) was assessed according to Garc\u00eda-Ruiz et al. (2014) [24] and Zhang et al. (2019) [25] with slight modifications. Aseptically, the SGJ was formulated with H2O, pepsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) (0.32%), and NaCl (0.2%), and NaOH and HCl were utilized to adjust the pH. The simulated gastric juice was set to five concentration gradients (pH 7.0, 5.0, 4.0, 3.0, and 2.0) with 1 M HCl and 1 M NaOH. Cultures ofS. thermophilusandL. bulgaricuswere inoculated (5% [v/v]), individually, into SGJ and incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 \u00b0C (S. thermophilus) and anaerobically at 43 \u00b0C (L. bulgaricus) for 30 min. The counts of viable bacteria were enumerated by plate counting at 0 and 30 min of incubation.2.10. Lysozyme Tolerance TestResistance ofS. thermophilusandL. bulgaricusto lysozyme was determined by the method described by Zago et al. (2011) [26] with modifications. Cultures were evaluated for their capacity to survive in a filter sterile electrolyte solution (0.22 g/L CaCl2, 6.2 g/L NaCl, 2.2 g/L KCl, 1.2 g/L NaHCO3) in the presence of 100 mg/L of lysozyme (SigmaeAldrich). Starter cultures were inoculated (10% [v/v]) into the electrolyte solution and incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 \u00b0C (S. thermophilus) and anaerobically at 43 \u00b0C (L. bulgaricus). The counts of viable bacteria were enumerated by plate counting at 0, 30, and 120 min of incubation.2.11. Protease ActivityThe extracellular protease activity ofS. thermophilusandL. bulgaricuswas determined by the o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) spectrophotometric assay according to the method described by Oberg et al. (1991) [27].S. thermophilusandL. bulgaricuswere inoculated (1% [v/v]) into sterile skim milk (autoclaved at 12 \u00b0C for 15 min) and incubated at 40 \u00b0C for 0, 12, and 24 h. After incubation, 2.5 mL from each sample was mixed with 1 mL distilled water and transferred into test tubes containing 5 mL of 0.75N trichloroacetic acid (TCA) (Fisher Scientific), and the test tubes were vortexed at the same time. After setting at room temperature for 10 min, the acidified samples were filtered through a Whatman Number 2 filter paper (Clifton, NJ, USA). Non-inoculated sterile skim milk was prepared similarly to be used as a reference in a duplicate aliquot from each TCA filtrate and was analyzed by the o-phthaldialdehyde (OPA) spectrophotometric assay with a UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Nicolet Evolution 100, Thermo Scientific; Madison, WI, USA). The o-phthaldialdehyde final solution was prepared by combining the following reagents and diluting to a final volume of 50 mL with distilled water: 25 mL of 100 mM sodium borate (Fisher Scientific); 2.5 mL 20% (wt/wt) SDS (Fisher Scientific); 40 mg of o-phthaldialdehyde reagent (Alfa Aesar, Ward Hill, MA, USA) dissolved in 1 mL methanol (Sigma); and 100 \u00b5L of \u03b2-mercaptoe. A total of 150 \u00b5L of each TCA filtrate was mixed with 3 mL of ophthaldialdehyde final solution in a 3 mL cuvette, and the absorbance at 340 nm was read. The absorbance of the o-phthaldialdehyde final solution with the non-inoculated sterile skim milk (reference) was subtracted from each sample reading. The o-phthaldialdehyde reagent solution (sigma) was used as a blank and the milk with or without the ingredient was used as the control [27]. The protease activity (PA) was calculated by Equation (3).PA (%) = (100 \u2212 ((SA \u2212 BA)/CA)) \u00d7 100(3)where SA is the absorbance of the sample and BA and CA are the absorbance from the blank and control, respectively.2.12. Enumeration of S. thermophilusAgar forStreptococcus thermophiluswas prepared using the following method: To 1 L of distilled water, the following ingredients were added using individual plastic weighing boats: 10 g of sucrose (Amresco, Solon, OH, USA), 2 g of K2HPO4(Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA), 5 g of Bacto yeast extract, and 10 g of Bacto Tryptone (Becton, Dickinson and Co., Sparks, MD, USA). Distilled water was transferred from the graduated cylinder to a 2 L Erlenmeyer flask. The mix was stirred to dissolve the ingredients. To reduce the pH to 6.8, 1 N HCl was added. Then, 12 g of agar (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA) was added to the medium and 6 mL of 0.5% bromocresol purple was added (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA). The media was heated to boiling, and it was autoclaved at 121 \u00b0C for 15 min. Samples were diluted with 99 mL of sterilized MgCl2KOH. Then, 1 mL of each diluted sample was pipetted into Petri dishes and then the media was aseptically poured into the Petri dish. Petri dishes were aerobically incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h. To enumerate the colonies, a Quebec Darkfield Colony Counter (Leica Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA) was used.2.13. Enumeration of L. bulgaricusLactobacilli MRS agar was prepared using 1 L of distilled water, 15 g of agar (Fisher Scientific, Fair Lawn, NJ, USA), and 55 g of Lactobacilli MRS broth powder (Becton, Dickinson and Co., Sparks, MD, USA). The pH was adjusted to 5.2 using 1 N HCl. The medium was heated to boiling with agitation. Then, the medium was autoclaved at 121 \u00b0C for 15 min. The sample was diluted in serial dilutions with 99 mL of sterilized MgCl2 KOH. A 1 mL volume of each diluted sample was pipetted into Petri dishes and then the medium was aseptically poured into the Petri dish. Petri dishes were placed in a BBL GasPaks (BBL, Becton, Dickinson and Co., Cockeysville, MD, USA) and then they were incubated anaerobically at 43 \u00b0C for 72 h. To enumerate the colonies, a Quebec Darkfield Colony Counter (Leica Inc., Buffalo, NY, USA) was used.2.14. Statistical AnalysisData were analyzed using the General Linear Model (PROC GLM) of the Statistical Analysis Systems (SAS). Differences of least square means were used to determine significant differences atp< 0.05 for main effects (ingredients vs. control). Data are presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. Significant differences were determined at \u03b1 = 0.05. For chemical analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied. Tukey\u2019s test examined the statistical differences (p< 0.05) among the treatments and the main and interaction effects of the General Linear Model.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Chemical Compositions and Antioxidant Activity of Different Food SourcesTable 1indicates the results of the proximal composition of flours of the carao tissue. Seeds, pulp, and crust have significantly different (p< 0.05) amounts of ash, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrate. The pulp of the carao has the highest moisture (12.55 \u00b1 0.44%), ash (6.45 \u00b1 0.15%), lipids (0.66 \u00b1 0.07%), and proteins (16.56 \u00b1 0.21%). The crust of the carao has the lowest moisture (10.23 \u00b1 0.38%) and protein (2.41 \u00b1 0.45%). Seeds of the carao have the lowest lipids (0.15 \u00b1 0.09%) and ash (1.97 \u00b1 0.34%).Table 2indicates the TPC, TCC, and antioxidant activity of the carao tissue to compare their antioxidation ability. Seeds of carao have the highest TPC (766.87 \u00b1 11.56 \u03bcg GAE/mL), TCC (7.43 \u00b1 0.31 mg Q/Ml), and antioxidant activity (40.76 \u00b1 1.87%). The crust of carao has the lowest TPC (245.55 \u00b1 10.48 \u03bcg GAE/mL)\u2019 TCC (4.73 \u00b1 0.33 mg Q/mL) and antioxidant activity (22.88 \u00b1 2.84%). Pulp and crust indicated high TCC with significant differences (6.12 \u00b1 0.45, 4.73 \u00b1 0.33 mg Q/mL, respectively). Seeds, pulp, and crust have significantly different (p< 0.05) amounts of ash, lipids, proteins, and carbohydrate.Table 3andTable 4show the important sugar and acid content (g/100 g) of seeds, pulp, and crust of carao. Pulp had the highest amount of sucrose and fructose (9.07 \u00b1 0.78 and 3.76 \u00b1 0.06 g/100 g, respectively) compared to seeds and crust. Also, maltose was not detected in seeds and crust significantly. Seeds and crust did not have significantly different (p> 0.05) amounts of sucrose. The only source in which maltose was detected was pulp (0.35 \u00b1 0.05 g/100 g). Seeds had the highest significance (p< 0.05) amounts of citric acid (1.02 \u00b1 0.19 g/100 g) and lowest amounts of succinic acid (0.27 \u00b1 0.02 g/100 g) compared to other sources. Crust had the highest succinic acid (2.01 \u00b1 0.06 g/100 g).Carao is a plant that is thought to have nutritional properties. The total phenolic compounds, minerals such as magnesium and calcium, and antioxidant activity evaluated by Marcia et al. (2020) [28] indicated higher amounts in the seeds compared to the crust and pulp. On the other hand, the total carotenoid content showed a higher concentration in the pulp, while microminerals such as manganese were more present in the crust [28]. The results of the chemical analysis implied that the rich content of sugar in the pulp can enhance the growth of lactic acid bacteria.3.2. Bile ToleranceCommonly, bile salts cause a leakage of hazardous particles by emulsifying the lipid content of the cell wall [29].Figure 1represents ST tolerance to bile and assesses if plant resources help cultures to be maintained longer in media. Pulp caused the highest stability in ST counts, and there was no significant difference (p< 0.05) among control, seed, and pulp at the start (0 h). After 4 h, a decrease in ST counts for seed treatment could be observed compared to the control, pulp, and crust, which had no significant difference in ST counts. Seed treatment continued to decrease till 8 h, and control, pulp, and crust treatments experienced a decrease, and they had no meaningful difference from each other.Figure 2represents LB tolerance to bile and assesses if plant resources help cultures to be maintained longer in media. For LB counts, the pattern is different; pulp showed the highest counts significantly. The lowest bacterial counts resulted from the control treatment at 0, 4, and 8 h of the experiment. Although crust and pulp had a downward trend all the time, they were not significantly different from each other after 8 h. The highest LB count at the end of the experiment against bile resulted from pulp treatments. The results showed that ST was more stable than LB against bile.Also, Vargas et al. [30] reported growth decays ofS. thermophilus(in M17 broth) andL. bulgaricus(in MRS broth), respectively, in broth with oxgall (0.3%). Paz et al. (2022) [31] reported that carao pulp improved the bile tolerance ofS. thermophilus(in M17 broth) andL. bulgaricus(in MRS broth). We hypothesize that carao could serve as an enzymatic inhibitor and act as a barrier between the lipid membrane and bile salts to shield these bacteria. Nevertheless, the hypothesis needs to be confirmed with further studies. The results of the bile tolerance test implied that the carao pulp could enhance the growth of lactic acid bacteria in digestion.3.3. Acid Tolerance and Gastric Juice ResistanceFigure 3(S. thermophilus; ST) andFigure 4(L. bulgaricus; LB) illustrate the acid resistance of ST and LB.Figure 5(ST) andFigure 6(LB) illustrate the gastric juice resistance of ST and LB. Acid resistance was evaluated over a 60 min period, during which bacterial counts were monitored to investigate how plant sources influenced cultures\u2019 activity and viability, simulating stomach conditions. In all treatments, ST counts displayed a noticeable reduction (p> 0.05) after 60 min. Pulp treatment had the highest resistance against acid, and seed treatment had the lowest survival after 60 min. All treatments indicated no significant difference from each other by the end of the experiment. LB counts for all treatments (control, seed, pulp, and crust) were different from ST results. Control experienced the lowest bacterial counts at all times. Seed treatments had no significant changes after 30 min, and crust treatment had the highest bacterial counts. At 0 h, the growth showed a significant decrease (p< 0.05) till 30 min. The tolerance to gastric juice had a similar trend to acid tolerance. The addition of the plant sources was ineffective on the acid tolerance of bacteria after 30 min, and LB was sensitive to acid that was not detected after 30 min and had a lower bacterial count than ST. The results of the acid tolerance test implied that the carao pulp could enhance the growth of lactic acid bacteria in gastric digestion.3.4. Resistance to LysozymeResistance to lysozyme is indicated inFigure 7for ST. The initial count of ST in the control had no significant difference from other treatments. The highest ST counts resulted from the seed sample, and the crust had the lowest ST counts at the end of the lysozyme resistance experiment (2 h). Seed treatments experienced an initial decrease after 1 h, and then an increase after 2 h. Crust experienced a slight increase after 1 h and then dramatically decreased after 2 h. Resistance to lysozyme is indicated inFigure 8. LB bacterial count experienced a decrease in all treatments. Treatments indicated dramatic differences at the initial count, and they decreased slightly after 1 h. The lowest LB counts resulted from the control treatment at the end, which was not significantly different (p> 0.05) from seed and crust treatments. Other treatments (pulp and crust) indicated the same LB counts at the end of the experiment.Marcia et al. (2023) [32] examined the lysozyme tolerance ofL. acidophilusand concluded that carao pulp improved growth. Lysozyme is a natural enzyme that acts as a defense against probiotic bacteria [33]. This enzyme is found naturally in tears, saliva, mucus, and milk of human origin. Lysozyme works by attacking the peptidoglycans present in the cell walls of Gram-positive bacteria (while Gram-negative bacteria are less susceptible to attack due to the complexity of their cell walls) [34]. Lysozyme causes cleavage of the \u03b2(1-4) bond between N-acetylmuramic acid (NAM) and N-acetylglucosamine peptidoglycan (NAG) [35]. The results of the lysozyme tolerance test implied that the carao crust could inhibit the growth of lactic acid bacteria in the oral cavity.3.5. Protease ActivityThe protease activity of ST is indicated inFigure 9. The protease activity of ST showed an increase in 12 h and a slight decrease in 24 h for all treatments. The control had no significant difference (p> 0.05). Seeds had the lowest absorbance and no significant difference from crust, which had the highest absorbance at the end of the experiment. Control treatments had no significant difference from 0 to 24 h.The protease activity of LB is indicated inFigure 10. LB protease activity was the lowest for the pulp treatment at the time 0 h, and it decreased over 24 h, with the lowest protease activity among others. Seed was the only treatment that was significantly highest at time 0. First, it decreased after 12 h and then increased slightly after 24 h. The lowest protease activity for LB was detected in the control treatment after 24 h. The protease activity of ST was higher than the protease activity of LB at the end of the experiment.Paz et al. (2022) [31] examined the protease activity ofL. bulgaricusand concluded that carao pulp improved protease activity. Proteolytic bacteria, which are mainly housed in the large intestine, represent less than 0.001% of the microbiota and includeBiovare coli,Clostridium,Proteus,Pseudomonas,Enterobacter,Citrobacter, andKlebsiella, among others [36]. The proteolytic activity is carried out by heat-resistant proteases, naturally present in milk or produced by bacteria, particularly from the psychrotrophic group, which break down \u03ba-casein [37]. Proteolysis in fermented milk is essential for several aspects: it can determine the survival of the starter cultures, contribute to undesired flavor and odor, grant technological characteristics, and allow the formation of bioactive peptides [38,39].4. ConclusionsCarao components such as seeds, pulp, and crust were examined to determine how they influence the growth and behavior of ST and LB under various challenging conditions, such as exposure to acid, lysozyme, bile, and gastric juice. While the seed and crust of carao did not exhibit beneficial effects on the viable counts of ST and LB, the pulp had adverse effects on bile tolerance and increased protease activity within the cultures. The carao\u2019s pulp can be used in fermented dairy products when applied for fortification purposes to enhance nutritional content.Author ContributionsConceptualization, M.M.T., R.S.A. and A.K.; methodology, R.S.A., A.A. and D.A.; software, R.S.A.; formal analysis, M.M.T., (most of the research) R.S.A., A.C., A.Y., R.C., A.A. and D.A.; resources, R.S.A., J.M., A.K. and D.P.; data curation, R.S.A.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, R.S.A.; writing\u2014review and editing, R.S.A., S.K., L.K.P. and A.K.; project administration, R.S.A. and A.K.; funding acquisition, R.S.A. and A.K.

        "title": "Medical Scope of Biofilm and Quorum Sensing during Biofilm Formation: Systematic Review",
        "abstract": "Biofilms are accumulations of microorganisms in an extracellular polymeric substance matrix which are composed of polysaccharides, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Many bacteria can switch between a planktonic form and a biofilm form. The planktonic bacteria have relatively high cell growth and reproduction rates and have a reduced likelihood of survival but can adapt to occupy new habitats. The biofilm state appears to be a natural and predominant state of bacteria. The need for the formation of bacterial biofilm is that it enhances the tolerance of bacteria to harsh environmental conditions, thereby allowing bacteria to avoid being washed away by water flow or the bloodstream by simply attaching to a surface or tissue, and the EPS matrix protects bacteria cells, in deeper layers, against antimicrobial agents, probably by limiting the diffusion of these agents. Biofilm formation steps are initial contact/attachment to the surface, followed by micro-colony formation, maturation and formation of the architecture of the biofilm, and finally detachment/dispersion of the biofilm. Once formed, biofilm restricts bacterial mobility and increases cell density. Secretions of autoinducers into the environment are critical for cross-signaling between bacteria. This cross-talk is called quorum sensing (QS). Quorum sensing is a cell\u2013cell communication mechanism between bacteria that allows specific processes to be controlled, such as biofilm formation and virulence factor expression. Bacterial quorum sensing signaling mainly consists of acyl-homoserine lactones (produced by Gram-negatives), autoinducing peptides (produced by Gram-positives), and autoinducer-2 (produced by both Gram-negatives and Gram-positives). Therefore, this review is aimed at how bacterial biofilms work and are formed.",

        "content": "1. IntroductionThe discovery of biofilms can be traced back to Anthony van Leeuwenhoek\u2019s observation of surface-associated bacteria in 1684. However, the term \u201cbiofilm\u201d was officially introduced and defined in a paper by Costerton et al. in 1978. In 1993, the American Society for Microbiology recognized the significance of biofilms as structured communities of bacterial cells enclosed in a self-produced polymeric matrix adherent to surfaces. This matrix, comprising polysaccharides, proteins, and DNA, acts as a protective barrier shielding bacteria from various environmental stresses [1,2,3].Quorum sensing (QS), a form of cell-to-cell communication, involves the synthesis and release of signaling molecules called autoinducers by bacteria. As the bacterial population density increases, the concentration of these signaling chemicals rises, prompting bacteria to respond collectively once a minimum threshold concentration is reached. QS hastens bacteria to regulate behaviors such as biofilm formation and pathogenicity in a synchronized manner based on species complexity and cell density. This communication mechanism allows bacteria to switch between individual antisocial behavior at low cell density and collective community behavior at high cell density. Bacterial QS systems share fundamental methods for identifying and responding to changes in bacterial cell numbers, facilitating adaptation to environmental variations. Moreover, QS is a crucial mechanism in bacterial communication where signaling molecules called autoinducers mediate interactions within bacterial populations. This density-dependent process allows bacteria to coordinate and function as a unified group, regulating various functions such as secondary metabolite production, sporulation, biofilm formation, and symbiosis [4,5,6].The three fundamental principles of bacterial QS include, firstly, concentration-dependent response to autoinducers that autoinducers release outside the bacterial cell, and their effects are influenced by their concentration levels, triggering specific responses within the bacterial community; secondly, specialized receptors that bacteria possess in their cell membrane or cytoplasm that can detect and respond to the concentration of autoinducers, allowing for the initiation of QS pathways; and lastly, the activation of the QS loop, of which the detection of autoinducers by receptors initiates the QS loop, leading to the regulation of bacterial virulence factors and behaviors [7].For many medically significant bacteria, includingPseudomonas aeruginosa(P. aeruginosa),Escherichia coli(E. coli), andStaphylococcus aureus(S. aureus), biofilm formation is a key mechanism of virulence in their pathogenesis. Numerous illnesses are linked to or caused by biofilm infections, such as otitis, conjunctivitis, vaginitis, colitis, pneumonia (ventilator-related), gingivitis, and urethritis. In fact, it is estimated that biofilms directly cause around 80% of all microbial infections in people, and treating these diseases associated with biofilms costs more than USD 1 billion a year.P. aeruginosabiofilms in the lungs of patients with cystic fibrosis are one biofilm-related infection that is very concerning to medical professionals. An opportunistic bacterium calledP. aeruginosahas been linked to both acute and chronic lung infections, which can have a serious negative impact on morbidity and death [7,8].Chronic wound infections are another area of great concern. Over 80% of the 100,000 limb amputations performed on patients with diabetes annually are thought to be the result of extremely persistent biofilm-related wound infections, which mostly include the bacteriaP. aeruginosaandS. aureus[7].Implanted medical devices are another crucial area to take into account when thinking about biofilm and biofilm-related infections. While these implanted medical devices, which can include orthopedic implants, pacemakers, urine catheters, heart valves, stents, and intravascular catheters, are frequently employed to save lives, biofilm colonization can pose a serious risk to patient safety [1]. Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria have the ability to grow into biofilms on medical equipment, which can be fatal and result in chronic infections, device failure, and high rates of morbidity and death [1]. The most frequently occurring bacteria that are known to create biofilms on medical devices areS. aureus,Staphylococcus epidermidis(S. epidermidis),Streptococcus viridians(S. viridans),E. coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae(K. pneumoniae),Enterococcus faecalis(E. faecalis),Proteus mirabilis(P. mirabilis), andP. aeruginosa. S. aureusandS. epidermidisare assumed to be the origin of 40\u201350% of prosthetic heart valve infections, 50\u201370% of catheter biofilm infections, and 87% of bloodstream infections [1]. In addition, the chance of contracting an infection linked to the catheter rises by around 10% every day it is in place [9].According to estimates, biofilms are the source of between 65% and 80% of all microbial illnesses in hospitals that affect humans. Because biofilm infections are resistant to being removed by host defense systems and antimicrobials, once they are developed, they are particularly difficult to eradicate [10,11].The majority of existing antimicrobial treatments are typically created and assessed against bacteria that are in the free-living (planktonic) phase of life. As a result, pathogenic biofilms, which are up to 1000 times more resistant to antibiotic treatments, are typically unaffected by these treatments [7]. They are extremely challenging to successfully treat and remove due to the phenomenon of biofilm recalcitrance. Therefore, there is an urgent need for innovative approaches to biofilm treatment, dispersal, and prevention. An overview of bacterial biofilm production, QS, signaling mechanisms, and the current approaches to biofilm removal, control, and prevention are presented in this session.2. MethodsA literature search was conducted on PubMed to identify all published or electronically published English-language articles relevant to biofilm, QS, and cross-talk in bacteria; a total of 96 records from 2014 to 2023 were included. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) methodology was employed for the literature search and selection. The search was carried out for clinical trials, systematic reviews, reviews, randomized controls, and research articles, which could be relevant information sources for this work. In PubMed, the following search string was used: ((\u201cBiofilm and Quorum Sensing\u201d [Mesh]) OR (Biofilm)) AND (((\u201cQuorum Sensing\u201d [Mesh]) OR (biofilm)) OR (biofilms)). For articles that included biofilm and QS, further screening was carried out. The article exclusion criteria used were text not in English, biofilms other than medical aspects, and biofilm and QS in other than bacteria (candida species and others) (Figure 1).3. Biofilm FormationA biofilm is a collection of microbial cells that are attached to surfaces and are encased in an extracellular matrix of polymeric substances. It is a synergetic community of microorganisms in which bacterial cells stick to each other and behave as microbial social [12,13].Biofilm formation is a complex process that depends on various environmental factors (surface porosity, fluid flow, nutrient availability, etc.). Extracellular polysaccharide matrix (EPS) has a significant role in biofilm formation. Molecular genetic studies onP. aeruginosashowed that activation of genes necessary for extracellular polysaccharide synthesis took place after establishing a stable connection between bacteria and the substrate surface [12].Biofilms will form on almost any material where nutrients are available, but it is more likely to happen if the attachment surface is rough, scratched, cracked, or corroded. Physical conditions, such as hydrophobicity, surface electrostatic charge, and fluid flow rate, also affect the attachment. Several studies have shown that microorganisms attach more rapidly to hydrophobic, nonpolar surfaces such as Teflon and other plastics than to hydrophilic surfaces like stainless steel, so some kind of hydrophobic interaction apparently occurs, which enables the cells to overcome the repulsive forces [13].Unattached free-swimming bacteria (planktonic) initially attach to a solid surface, eventually maturing into structured aggregates called micro-colonies. Biofilms are composed of these micro-colonies, often encased in extracellular polymeric substances known as the matrix. Some biofilm bacteria detach from microcolonies and become planktonic, presumably colonizing a new surface [14].Biofilm formation occurs in a few common steps controlled by (QS): initial contact/attachment to the surface, followed by micro-colony formation, maturation and formation of the architecture of the biofilm, and finally, detachment/dispersion of the biofilm [12]. The diagram representation of biofilm formation is shown as inFigure 2.4. Initial Attachment to the SurfaceIn this step of biofilm formation, microbial cells attach to the biotic or abiotic surface by using their appendages like pilli and flagella and via other physical forces like van der Waal\u2019s forces, electrostatic interactions, etc. Two types of attachment occur in this step: adhesion\u2014the attachment of microbial cells to a surface, and cohesion\u2014the interaction/attachment within the cells [14]. The flagella, fimbriae, and Pilli give strength to the interaction between bacteria and the surface of attachment. In addition, the hydrophobic nature of the surface also plays a role in strengthening the attachment of microbes by reducing the force of repulsion between the bacteria and the surface [16,17]. Studies have reported the involvement of QS in the initial stages of biofilm development, attachment, and mobility. InP. aeruginosa, QS becomes active during irreversible attachment. In humanHelicobacter pyloriandSalmonella typhimurium, QS may also be involved in the attachment phase via theluxPgene regulator. (luxPis a gene coding for the extensive protein family known as periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs). These proteins are important binding sites for ligands of biofilm formation and are classically called autoinducers [18].5. Micro-Colony FormationAfter microorganisms attach to a biotic or an abiotic surface and this attachment becomes stable, a process of multiplication of microbial cells starts and the formation of the EPS matrix fixes the initial adhesion. This process of division then leads to the formation of micro-colonies [17]. Microbial colonies in a biofilm usually consist of many types of micro-communities that coordinate with one another in multiple aspects. The exchange of substrate, the distribution of significant metabolic products, and the excretion of metabolic end products are all significantly impacted by this coordination. For example, when complex organic matter is transformed into CH4and CO2during anaerobic digestion, at least three different species of bacteria must be involved: (i) Fermentative bacteria begin converting organic molecules into acid and alcohol. (ii) These products are, in turn, consumed by acetogenic bacteria as their substrates. (iii) Methanogenic bacteria obtain energy by converting the acetate, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen into methane. The development of biofilms provides an appropriate environment for the development of the syntrophic association, an association of two or more metabolically different bacteria that are dependent on each other for the utilization of certain substrates for their energy purposes [19].On the other hand, the EPS encasing the cells in a biofilm, which is composed of a complex mixture of proteins, lipids, extracellular-DNA (eDNA), and polysaccharides, not only assists in securing the adhesion of biofilm to the surface but also provide structural support, shield against host immune responses and antimicrobial agents and trap nutrients. In addition, it is also responsible for holding the community of cells in close proximity, enabling cell-to-cell communication (QS), and facilitating genetic material exchange via horizontal gene transfer [20].6. Maturation and ArchitectureThese low-molecular-weight biochemicals are stimuli for bacteria to respond accordingly (inter or intra-species) and start cross-talk. Just stimuli are not environmental or not from the host, hence the name given to the autoinducer. This is based on their activity and how they act in their biological role. They stimulate the cells in the biofilm community by binding with theluxPproteins, which are periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) or receptors, and induce gene expression. The bacterial cells continuously create these autoinducers, and as cell density rises, so does their production until a critical threshold concentration is reached [20,21]. Many target genes are either activated or repressed as a result of autoinducer receptor engagement. The coordination of virulence phenotypes and preservation of the ideal biofilm size are two benefits of this communication process for the entire microbial community [22]. Beyond population density controlling, quorum sensing also aids in the spreading of beneficial mutations in the biofilm colony, enhances access to nutrients, and contributes to antibiotic tolerance. In this stage, interstitial voids (channels) are also produced in the matrix that are filled with water and act as a circulatory system [23].Among the genes that are regulated via quorum sensing, the bsmA andbsmBgenes, as well as C4-HSL, control the maturity of the biofilm in a number of Gram-negative bacteria, includingSerratia liquefaciensMG1. ThebsmAandbsmBgenes are important genes that encode proteins that facilitate bacterial aggregation and adhesion. In these bacteria, a mutation at one of theluxIorluxR(genes coding for signaling molecules or autoinducers) homologs causes a flaccid, architecturally undifferentiated biofilm to grow [18].Figure 3illustrates quorum sensing in the following manner.7. Detachment/Dispersion of BiofilmAs the biofilm ages, it begins to accumulate harmful compounds and run out of resources. Thus, the cells begin to spread out to different areas in order to obtain nutrients, grow, and eliminate waste and situations that cause stress. Single cells or clusters of cells that slough off the biofilm disperse during this dispersion [1,24]. It is said that an oxygen or nutritional shortage triggers this preprogrammed mechanism. Fatty acid diffusible signal factor (DSF) (cis-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid) is stimulated by hunger, and this causes auto-phosphorylation, which in turn activates c-di-GMP phosphodiesterase, which breaks down c-di-GMP. When c-di-GMP degrades, planktonic cells are released, which dissolve part of the EPS, or shear forces tear clusters apart [1].The production of various saccharolytic enzymes by the microbial communities within the biofilm facilitates the release of the microorganisms\u2019 surface into a new area for colonization, which is another mechanism for the dissolution of EPS during the detachment process. For example, alginate lyase is produced byP. aeruginosaandPseudomonas fluorescens, N-acetyl-heparosan lyase is produced byE. coli, and hyaluronidase is produced byStreptococcus equifor the lysis of the EPS matrix and subsequent detachment [19]. Following their release, these microorganisms either form new biofilms in other parts of the body or float freely on the surface by overexpressing the flagella protein, which aids in their movement [1,24]. Detachment of microbial cells and transfer to a new site aids in the spreading of infections [25].In different bacterial species, individual cells inside a biofilm can separate from the biofilm. Bacteria can reproduce by spreading and/or aggregating, which enables them to colonies new surfaces and restart the formation of biofilms. In certain bacteria, QS control would govern the bacterial dispersion and/or detachment. Under conditions of overpopulation in nutrient-poor niches, QS can be a perfect way to mediate the release of bacteria from the biofilm so they can colonies other surfaces. Research has demonstrated that a mutation in the genes responsible for the dispersion of the affected bacteria primarily results in hyper-aggregation and/or an increase in the creation of the biofilm [18,26]. Quorum sensing is believed to be involved in regulating different steps of biofilm development, depending on the organisms and growth conditions (Figure 4).8. Quorum Sensing and Cross-Communication in BacteriaBacteria secrete tiny chemicals (autoinducers, (AIs)) into their surroundings to enable cross-signaling. The name \u201cquorum sensing\u201d refers to this cross-talk in the microbial community [27,28]. Bacterial cell-to-cell communication enables the control of particular processes, including the formation of biofilms, the expression of virulence factors, the synthesis of secondary metabolites, and stress adaptation mechanisms like secretion systems (SS) and bacterial competition systems. These SS play a significant part in the communication between bacteria. Secretion systems are crucial to the biology of bacteria, where molecules are transferred, usually proteins, from the cytoplasm of bacteria to the outer membrane, from a donor bacterium to the environment, or to a recipient bacterium. It might also be the direct translocation of the molecules to the target host cell [29]. At large cell densities, quorum sensing controls the expression of genes. The concentration of an autoinducer, which the bacteria exude into the environment, reaches a threshold at high cell density and causes gene expression and the regulation of several cascades [30].The milieu\u2019s extracellular chemical signals that the bacteria make themselves have the ability to trigger bacterial quorum sensing signaling (Figure 3). Bacteria utilize QS signals, primarily composed of acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs), autoinducing peptides (AIPs), and autoinducer-2 (AI-2), to participate in a range of physiological processes, such as motility, plasmid conjugation, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistance. These mechanisms enable bacteria to adapt to and survive in adverse environments, and they also play a crucial role in regulating bacterial pathogenesis [31].Different QS signals are used by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria for cell-to-cell communication. Gram-negative bacteria are primarily responsible for producing AHL signaling molecules [32], while Gram-positive bacteria are responsible for producing AIP signaling molecules [33]. The AI-2 signals are produced and sensed by both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [34].The two most crucial proteins needed for QS signaling are N-acyl-homoserine lactone (acyl-HSL) synthase (I protein) and a transcription factor known as an R protein that has acyl-HSL-dependent activity [35]. A positive feedback regulatory mechanism is established when the R protein\u2013acyl\u2013HSL complex stimulates transcription of the genes encoding the R and I proteins. The acyl-HSL molecule is hence referred to as an autoinducer (AI). Activated R proteins also cause the transcription of genes encoding virulence factors in pathogenic QS bacteria likeP. aeruginosa[35,36].LasR/IandRhlR/IQS proteins are organized in a signaling cascade inP. aeruginosa.Therhlregulon is activated by theLasR\u2013AIcomplex and theRhlR\u2013C4\u2013HSLand LasR\u20133\u2013oxo\u2013C12\u2013HSL complexes both activate genes that encode virulence factors and other proteins required for survival in a human host [36].Biofilms, which are often mixed-species habitats present in many clinical, industrial, and natural settings, exhibit significant QS signal concentrations due to high cell densities. In multispecies biofilm communities, quorum sensing may exhibit both hostile and cooperative relationships [28].Synergistic Interactions: It has been proposed that AI-2 QS is crucial for encouraging interspecies interactions in the oral cavity. In lung infections caused by cystic fibrosis, interspecies QS contacts among AHL-producing microorganisms are crucial [28].Antagonistic Interactions: Microorganisms in the same niche are in constant competition with one another for shared resources. Mixed-species biofilms can have intense competition between competing species, with large numbers of cells attached in close proximity to one another. Two processes that may aid certain species in competing within biofilm communities are the synthesis of bacteriocin and pH reduction. QS has the ability to control the production of bacteriocin, which could be one of the ways that QS influences competition [28,37].9. Communication in Gram-Negative and Gram-Positive BacteriaThe chemical signal molecules or autoinducers that quorum sensing bacteria create and release eventually regulate the gene expression of the entire bacterial population. Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria both have quorum sensing systems, which use various chemical cues to regulate distinct target genes [3].N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) are an autoinducer signal molecule produced by Gram-negative proteobacteria that facilitates intra-species communication. Homoserine lactone (HSL) rings, which carry acyl chains ranging in length from C4 to C18, are the building blocks of acyl homoserine lactones [38,39]. Since acyl homoserine lactone molecules are known to diffuse freely across cell membranes, it is presumed that they will have little trouble diffusing freely in the biofilm matrix to reach their target receptors [40]. One well-known use of QS is the control of gene expression by AHL.Proteins involved in QS regulation are the I gene (luxI,phzI,traI,lasI, etc.), which converts cellular precursors into one or more AHL signals and AHL responsive regulatory protein (R protein), encoded by a gene referred to as an R gene (luxR,phzR,traR,lasR, etc.), required for the activation of specific genes. At low cell densities, the AHL signal either diffuses out of the cell following a concentration gradient or is actively transported out of the cell. As cell density increases, the concentration of AHL signal accumulates within the cell. On reaching a threshold level, the AHL interacts with the R protein, resulting in the dimerization of the R protein. This causes the R protein dimer to bind to a specific sequence in the promoter of the QS-regulated gene(s), which recruits RNA polymerase and activates gene expression [3,40].The traditional AHL-mediated QS communication networks are absent from Gram-positive bacteria. The majority of Gram-positive bacteria use small peptides as their primary communication molecules. But, some use \u03b3-butyrolactones (produced byStreptomyces species), molecules structurally related to AHLs, to regulate specific gene expression in a cell density-dependent manner. Gram-positive bacteria lack a porous outer membrane and instead contain a thick peptidoglycan layer that may restrict diffusion of the AHL signals via the cell wall [41].Peptide signaling is used by Gram-positive bacteria, and autoinducing peptides (AIPs) are oligopeptides that serve as signal molecules. Gradually increasing cell density leads to a rise in the concentration of peptide autoinducers. When the peptide autoinducers connect to membrane-bound histidine kinase receptors (H), they trigger a series of auto-phosphorylation events that lead to the phosphorylation of a conserved histidine residue in the cytoplasmic side by adenosine triphosphate (ATP). As a result, the phosphate group moved to a response regulator\u2019s aspartate residue (D). Target gene expression is regulated by these regulators, which function as transcription factors that bind DNA. Therefore, the transition from low cell density (LCD) to high cell density (HCD) is modulated by a positive feedback process that is akin to theLuxR/LuxIsystem [33].Because tiny peptides are expected to interact with charged molecules, signaling peptides produced by Gram-positive bacteria are likely impacted by physical, chemical, and biological variables inside a biofilm [41]. The synthesis of a signal peptide in Gram-positive bacteria is significantly more costly. Gram-positive biofilms\u2019 signal peptide-mediated QS and activities will be significantly influenced by nutrients or energy sources [42].A two-component regulatory system is included in a QS variation used by the majority of Gram-positive bacteria. The term \u201cthree-component QS system\u201d refers to this combination regulatory system. A cytoplasmic response regulator protein (RR) and a histidine kinase (HSK) sensor protein located in the cell membrane make up this three-component quorum sensing system. The generating cell secretes an autoinducing peptide (AIP), which is coupled to this two-component system [43]. Probiotics are a kind of microorganisms that are another example of Gram-positive cell\u2013cell signaling. Probiotics are beneficial bacteria found in the intestines that improve the health of their human or animal hosts by preventing harmful bacteria from colonizing. Probiotics prevent colonization by producing peptides outside of cells called bacteriocins (antimicrobial molecules that are secreted while bacteria are in their biofilm state) [3].10. Clinical Implication of BiofilmsAccording to the National Institutes of Health (NIH more than 80% of all microbial infections are biofilm-related [44]. These kinds of infections are hard to diagnose and treat.Ear infections: There are a number of pathogens capable of causing either otitis externa or otitis media. Most otitis media infecting pathogens relate to infections of repertory infections. Biofilm formation aided the chance for Non-typeableHaemophilus influenzae(NTHi)Moraxella catarrhalis,Streptococcus pneumoniae, andPseudomonas aeruginosato cause different ear infections. For otitis externa, using hearing aids increased the chance of biofilm formation [45,46].Eye infection: A corneal infection called bacterial keratitis can impair vision or even result in the loss of vision of the affected eye. In developing nations, it continues to be a leading cause of blindness. Common causal culprits includeStaphylococcus aureusandPseudomonas aeruginosa, both of which are known to form biofilm populations on the corneal surface [47,48].Cystic fibrosis (CF): It is linked toP. aeruginosa, which produces oily mucus in the lungs that obstructs airways and makes breathing difficult for patients. The majority ofP. aeruginosainfections acquired in hospitals are not always curable, while antibiotic therapy frequently reduces illness symptoms.P. aeruginosabiofilms, which serve as reservoirs for disease recurrence, are primarily to blame for the lack of a full cure [49]. The elements of biofilms, such as alginate, the main polysaccharide in theP. aeruginosamatrix, are virulence factors in addition to serving as disease reservoirs. Alginate, for instance, can harm the lungs [50].Dental plaque: There are reportedly more than 700 different types of bacteria and archaea in tooth plaque. Many biofilms make up dental plaque. But, the makeup of disease-associated plaque biofilms differs greatly from that of the healthy plaque biofilm [51].Dental biofilm is reformed as soon as the teeth are cleaned because of the pellicle\u2019s adsorption, an organic coating that serves as a location for bacterial receptors. Bacteria stick to previously attached bacteria once pioneer bacteria make direct contact with the pellicle. The most frequent early colonizers of dental biofilms are streptococcal species. If the dental biofilm is not disturbed, it will shift from being primarily formed of Gram-positive cocci to a high number of cocci, filamentous organisms, spirils, and spirochetes [52].Wounds: Chronic wounds frequently include biofilms. In contrast to an acute wound, which is typically unrelated to biofilm, a chronic wound caused by biofilm endures and heals slowly. AlthoughP. aeruginosabiofilms are embedded in the deep layers of wounds, biofilms typically grow on the outer layer of wounds and are challenging to diagnose using a standard wound swab culture [53,54].Urinary infection: Urinary tract biomaterials, like catheters, raise the risk of bacterial biofilm formation and subsequent urinary tract infection [54,55]. The artificial alien material offers surfaces on which bacteria can adhere. Bacterial biofilms infect nearly all urinary catheters. Patients may need to replace obstructed catheters due to the presence of biofilms such asP. mirabilisbiofilms, which have the potential to be crystalline in nature and can obstruct catheters [56].Prosthetic joint infection: Bacteria causing prosthetic joint infection are usually Gram-positive, such as staphylococci. Most often, immediately after surgery, bacteria (which could come from blood or lymph) attach to the surface of prosthetic joints to form biofilms (Table 1). Unlike typical bacterial infections that give symptoms like fever, it could take a while before symptoms of the biofilms on these implants, such as pain, emerge [57].Cardiac valve infection: Endocarditis of the prosthetic valve is a condition caused by bacterial biofilm on the mechanical heart valve.S. epidermidis,S. aureus,Streptococcus species,Corynebacterium species, andEnterococcus speciesare the species that cause endocarditis. The artificial heart valve may become blocked or disrupted by accumulated biofilm, which could cause turbulence, reduced flow, or even leakage (Table 1). It is possible for detached biofilm cells to spread throughout the bloodstream and infect different organs. Blood at the terminal may become blocked by biofilm pieces in the blood circulation [58].Table 1.Summary of biofilm-associated microorganisms commonly isolated from selected indwelling medical devices [54,59].Table 1.Summary of biofilm-associated microorganisms commonly isolated from selected indwelling medical devices [54,59].Indwelling Medical DeviceOrganismsCentral venous catheter [58,59]Coagulase-negative staphylococci,S. aureus,Enterococcus faecalis,K. pneumoniae,P. aeruginosaProsthetic heart valve [54,59]ViridansStreptococcus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, enterococci,S. aureusUrinary catheter [54,59]Staphylococcus epidermidis,Escherichia coli,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Enterococcus faecalis,Proteus mirabilisArtificial hip prosthesis [54,59]Coagulase-negative staphylococci,b-hemolytic streptococci,enterococci,Proteus mirabilis,Bacterioidesspecies,Staphylococcus aureus, viridansStreptococcus,E. coli,P. aeruginosaArtificial voice prosthesis [54,59]Streptococcus mitis,Streptococcus salivarius,Rothia dentrocariosa,Streptococcus sobrinus,Staphylococcus epidermidis,Stomatococcus mucilaginousIntrauterine device [54,59]S. epidermidis,Corynebacteriumspecies,S. aureus,Micrococcusspecies,Lactobacillus plantarum, group B streptococci,Enterococcusspecies11. Biofilms Enhance Antibiotic Tolerance and ResistanceThe ability of bacteria to survive antibiotic therapy without being able to multiply is known as antibiotic tolerance, whereas the ability to multiply under the same circumstances is known as resistance [7]. According to studies, bacteria that develop in biofilms are frequently thousands of times more resistant to antibiotic treatment than their counterparts that grow in planktonic media. Biofilm-mediated antibiotic tolerance does not seem to be primarily caused by the well-understood antibiotic resistance mechanisms in planktonic bacteria [60], which include mutations, efflux pumps, and antibiotic-modifying enzymes. For example, naturally drug-susceptible bacterial strains frequently show high levels of antibiotic tolerance when living in biofilms; nevertheless, these cells rapidly regain their susceptibility to antibiotics when they are freed from the biofilm and reintegrated into the main community. Consequently, BAT is thought to involve alternative mechanisms to bacterial antimicrobial resistance [1].Antibiotic resistance in biofilms can be either innate (arising from the formation of the biofilm) or induced (arising from the body\u2019s reaction to antimicrobial therapy). Since most antibiotics target rapidly replicating bacterial cells, innate BAT mechanisms include limited penetration due to EPS, reduced growth rate due to oxygen and food deprivation, and persister cell presence [1]. Furthermore, the efficacy of antibiotics may be limited by the capacity of bacteria within biofilms to undertake anaerobic metabolism in the absence of oxygen. It has also been observed that the cation-chelating characteristics of eDNA, which is produced during autolysis in the EPS, neutralize the effects of antibiotics such as tobramycin. Certain bacteria, such asP. aeruginosa, can also gain resistance by horizontal gene transfer. Multidrug efflux pumps are sometimes used by bacteria to transfer antibiotic drugs from developing biofilms into the extracellular matrix, hence promoting resistance [7].12. Quorum Sensing in Antibiotic ToleranceBacteria can interact with one another throughout the biofilm-building process thanks to QS. Planktonic cell metabolism is regulated by QS, which can also result in the formation of microbial biofilms and increased antibiotic resistance. Bacterial QS facilitates the biofilm form in which the bacterial cells hide themselves from antibiotics reaching them. In addition to this, QS alters the gene expression cascades at which the microbial metabolism and susceptibility to the existing antibiotics could be altered. The bacteria in biofilms also communicate via horizontal gene exchange, where the resistance genes could also be transferred [4,6]. In this regard, further investigations should be carried out. Most of the literature fails to conclude how QS and biofilm formation increase antibiotic resistance.13. Detection of Biofilm and Quorum Sensing Signaling MoleculesThere are several ways to find evidence of biofilm formation. These consist of the Fluorescence Microscopy Examination, Tissue Culture Plate, Tube technique (TM), Congo Red Agar method (CRA), bioluminescent test, and piezoelectric sensors [61,62]. Moreover, a number of sophisticated approaches, such as microscopy, spectroscopic, and immunological procedures, are available for the detection and investigation of biofilms at research facilities. These techniques, however, are not particularly appropriate for actual application in industry due to their complexity, high requirement for specialized personnel, and sophisticated instrumentation [62].For the detection of AHL, radiolabeled assays, colorimetric assays, and biosensors are the most often used analytical techniques. AHL is identified and quantified using a variety of techniques, including gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS), capillary electrophoresis\u2013mass spectrometry (CE-MS), matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization\u2013mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS), and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. However, GC-MS and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) are two analytical methods that can be employed for the identification and quantification of other QS molecules [62,63,64].14. Prevention, Control, and Removal of BiofilmTo date, three main approaches that focus on various phases of biofilm development have been investigated to regulate the production of biofilms. Preventing bacteria from adhering to surfaces in the first place is the first tactic. The third tactic is signal interference, which interferes with the bacterial communication system or the QS system. The second technique is to interrupt the biofilm maturation process (matrix degradation) [62].15. Inhibition of Initial AttachmentAs previously mentioned, a number of substances, such as adhesion surface proteins, pili or fimbriae, and exopolysaccharides, mediate the attachment of bacteria to surfaces [65]. Biofilm production is more likely on surfaces that are rough, hydrophobic, and covered in surface conditioning coatings. Thus, early cell attachment is prevented by altering the chemical or physical characteristics of indwelling medical device surfaces [66].1.Inhibition of initial attachment by Altering the Chemical Properties of materialsThe most widely utilized chemical techniques for altering the surfaces of biomedical devices to stop biofilm formation include antibiotics, biocides, and ion coatings. It has been demonstrated that using antibiotic-impregnated catheters, such as those containing rifampin or minocycline, can reduce the risk ofS. aureusbloodstream infections linked to biofilms in healthcare settings [67]. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that catheters impregnated with norfloxacin, nitrofurazone, and gentamicin may help reduce biofilm-associated UTIs [68].It is also known that a number of antimicrobial peptides, including peptide 1018, prevent the formation of biofilms in many bacterial pathogens. InP. aeruginosa,E. coli,A. baumannii,K. pneumoniae,S. aureus, andSalmonella typhimurium, this peptide is thought to function as a biofilm inhibitor [69]. Furthermore, it has been observed that lantibiotics, a class of peptide antibiotics that includes nisin, subtilin, epidermin, and gallidermin, preventS. aureusandS. epidermidisfrom forming biofilms [70].Conversely, chelators that obstruct the role of metal ions in the production of biofilms are also regarded as biofilm inhibitors. Medical implants have long employed metallic silver, silver salts, and silver nanoparticles as antimicrobial agents to combat bacteria likeCandida albicans,E. coli,S. aureus,P. aeruginosa, andKlebsiella species.It is anticipated that the application of silver therapy will impede DNA replication, ribosomal and cellular protein expression, and the respiration process, ultimately resulting in cell death [71]. Furthermore, in the presence of nanoparticles, medications, including amoxicillin, vancomycin, penicillin G, erythromycin, and clindamycin, showed enhanced antibacterial activity againstS. aureus[72].2.Inhibition of initial attachment by Changing the Physical Properties of materialsThe capacity of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is significantly influenced by the hydrophobicity and surface charge of implant materials. Therefore, it has been demonstrated that altering the hydrophobicity and surface charge of polymeric materials can effectively prevent the formation of biofilms. It has been observed that hydrophilic polymers, like hyaluronic acid and poly N-vinylpyrrolidone, inhibitS. epidermidisadhesion more than polyurethane catheters and silicone closures, respectively [56]. Furthermore, several hydrogel coatings with hydrophilic qualities have been created and have been shown to decrease bacterial adhesion, particularly for ureteral stents [73]. Because of their incredibly low wettability, superhydrophobic surfaces like titanium, fluorinated silica coating, and aerosol-aided chemical vapor deposition are suggested to decrease bacterial adherence and biofilm formation [74]. According to reports, heparin covering vascular catheters prevents thrombosis and microbial colonization, ultimately lowering the risk of catheter-related infections by interfering with the formation of bacterial biofilms by making the catheter negatively charged. Because surface roughness can change the hydrophobicity, which in turn affects bacterial adherence, it can also have an impact on biofilm development [75].16. Biofilm RemovalRemoving Biofilm by Matrix-Degrading EnzymesThe typical composition of the biofilm matrix is EPS-inclosing proteins, nucleic acids (eDNA and eRNA), lipids, polysaccharides, and other biomolecules. Via inhibiting the spread of antibiotics or directly causing antibiotic resistance, EPS and eDNAs play a significant role in antibiotic resistance. Dissociating the matrix, which makes up more than 90% of the dry mass of the biofilm, is a useful antibiofilm strategy because it exposes the sessile cells to antibiotics and the host immune system [76]. Enzymes that break down the biofilm matrix can be classified into three groups that break down polysaccharides: nucleases, proteases, and enzymes [77].Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitansproduces Dispersin-B, a bacterial glycoside hydrolase that breaks down poly-N-acetylglucosamine (PNAG), a significant matrix extracellular polymer ofE. coliandStaphylococcusspecies. Furthermore, triclosan and dispersin-B treatment successfully decreased the production of biofilms inS. aureus,S. epidermidis, andE. coli[78]. On the other hand, Endolysins, a class of peptidoglycan hydrolases produced by bacteriophages, are reported to digest the cell wall of bacteria, which in turn disrupts biofilms [79].Deoxyribonuclease I\u2019s ability to break down eDNA has been shown to spread biofilms in a variety of bacteria, including strains ofStaphylococcus,A. baumannii,E. coli,H. influenzae,K. pneumoniae, andP. aeruginosa[80]. By using Proteinase K to efficiently cleave matrix proteins, biofilm dispersal may also be achievable. Staphylococcus biofilms were shown to be effectively eliminated by treatment with dispersin B, followed by proteinase K or trypsin [81].Surfactants: Using surfactants such as sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), Tween 20, and Triton X-100 can help facilitate biofilm dispersal or detachment. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated thatB. subtilisproduces surfactin, a cyclic lipopeptide biosurfactant, which inhibits the formation of biofilms and promotes their dispersal inS. typhimurium,E. coli, andP. mirabilis[66].Free Fatty Acids: Studies have demonstrated the antibiofilm activity of free fatty acids against a variety of harmful bacteria. According to a paper by Kumar, P. et al., 2020,P. aeruginosa\u2019scis-2-decenoic acid is an organic chemical that can disperse established biofilms made byE. coli,K. pneumoniae,P. mirabilis,S. pyogenes,B. subtilis,S. aureus, andC. albicans[82]. Xanthomonas campestris produces cis-11-methyl-2-decanoic acid, or DSF, which can also promote biofilm dispersal by regulating the synthesis of an enzyme that breaks down exopolysaccharides [83].Nitric oxide donors: Nitric oxide generators such as sodium nitroprusside (SNP), S-nitrosoL-glutathione (GSNO), and S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP) that are reported to induce biofilm dispersal inP. aeruginosa[84]. A low dose of nitric oxide generators dispersedP. aeruginosabiofilms both in vitro and in cystic fibrosis sputum and enhanced the effect of antibiotics on biofilm-dispersed cells [66].17. Biofilm Inhibition by Quorum Quenching (QQ)Three QS system groups are recognized based on signaling molecules (autoinducers): Gram-negative bacteria based on N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs), Gram-positive bacteria based on autoinducing peptide (AIP), and both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria based on autoinducer-2 (AI-2). It has been proposed that inhibiting cell\u2013cell communication or quorum quenching (QQ) could be an intriguing method for stopping biofilm development because QS is essential to biofilm formation [85,86].AHL signal synthase, which is produced by theLuxIgene, and AHL receptor protein, which is encoded by theLuxRgene, are important for the functionality of AHL. AHL-mediated phenotypes have been attenuated by QQ techniques, including inhibiting AHL synthesis, inhibiting signal transit, degrading signal molecules, inhibiting AHL receptor production, inhibiting the formation of AHL-receptor complexes, and so forth [66].18. Inhibition of Signal SynthesisSeveral reports have shown that mutations affecting signal molecule synthesis have an adverse effect on biofilm formation. For example, theP. aeruginosastrain that lacked 3-oxo-C12-HSL production has shown impaired biofilm formation [87]. Several other species with mutations in the gene encoding for AHL and AI-2 synthesis enzymes were not able to produce biofilms properly. Thus, blocking signal production has been considered an important strategy to control biofilm formation.It is commonly recognized that molecules like S-adenosyl-homocysteine (SAH), sinefugin, 5-methylthioadenosine (MTA), and butyryl-SAM, which are analogs of the AHL precursor molecule S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM), prevent P. aeruginosa from forming biofilms. It has also been found that the antibiotic azithromycin and the SAM biosynthesis inhibitor cycloleucine prevent the synthesis of AHL. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that a number of inhibitors of the major enzymes involved in AI-2 synthesis lessen the formation of biofilms. However, it has been found that the minerals nickel (Ni2+) and cadmium (Cd2+) suppress the expression of the genes that produce AHL, which in turn suppresses cell\u2013cell signaling and, ultimately, the formation of biofilms inB. multivorans[88,89].19. Degradation of QS SignalsEnzymes that break down QS signaling molecules are produced by a variety of prokaryotes and certain eukaryotes. Four enzymes can break down AHLs; acylases and lactonases hydrolyze the amide bond and HSL ring of AHL, respectively; reductases and oxidases alter AHL activity but do not break it down [90]; oxidoreductases specifically target AI-2 [91]. Several bacterial strains have been shown to exhibit inhibited biofilm development upon administration of these degrading QQ enzymes. The biofilm architecture is upset by QQ enzymes, which makes the cells more susceptible to antibiotics. Following lactonase treatment,P. aeruginosashowed this situation [92]. It has been shown that inK. oxytocaandK. indica, the oxidoreductases convert the signaling molecules AHL and AI-2 to hydroxy-derivatives that are QS-inactive [66,91].20. Inhibition of Signal TransportThe synthesized signaling molecules need to be exported and released into the extracellular space to be sensed by other bacterial cells for effective cell-to-cell communication. The role of multidrug-resistant efflux pumps in signal traffic was reported in different species.Thus, inhibition of the efflux pump could also be an important strategy to alter the QS signaling cascade, thereby preventing biofilm formation and virulence. Several studies have tried to show the link between the physiological function of efflux pumps and biofilm formation. Of these inE. coliandKlebsiella strains, the inhibition of the efflux pump activity using efflux pump inhibitors (EPIs) reduced biofilm formation [93].Inactivation efflux pump activity either genetically or chemically resulted in impaired biofilm formation inS. enteric serovar typhimurium[94],P. aeruginosa, andS. aureus, in which copper nanoparticles work well as EPI and anti-biofilm agents [95]. In addition, inP. aeruginosa, silver nanoparticles were also reported to disrupt the MDR efflux pump [96].21. Antagonizing the Signal MoleculesUsing inductor antagonists is another method of interfering with QS. These antagonist molecules have two possible ways of binding to the receptor: either they attach non-competitively to the receptor and prevent the signal from entering the cell, or they bind competitively with inductors for the same binding site [94].For instance, it has been observed that AHL analogs that substituted a cyclopentyl or cyclohexanone ring for the lactone ring negatively impactedSerratia marcescensandP. aeruginosabiofilm formation. AHL-based QS signaling has also been shown to be antagonistic by natural substances such as bergamottin from grapefruit juice, patulin, cyclic sulfur compounds from garlic, and penicillic acid from a range of fungi. Furthermore, it is known that phenolic substances like baicalin hydrate and epigallocatechin inhibit AHL QS, which in turn influences the production of biofilms. Conversely, it has been observed that AI-2 analogs, including ursolic acid, isobutyl-4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione, and phenyl-DPD, prevent the formation of biofilms inP. aeruginosaandE. coliand eliminate those that have already formed. Furthermore, a number of AIP mimics include shortened AIP versions and naturally occurring probiotic bacteria [70].22. ConclusionsBacterial biofilms are evidently ubiquitous and hardy, and dealing with them is a problem. The stages of bacterial development on implants were described in this paper, along with a number of technologies that may be used to prevent or treat biofilms that cause infections. In vitro and in vivo bacteria typically exhibit distinct behaviors. Thus, a thorough investigation of the in vivo behavior of bacterial biofilms is necessary. Recurrence of infections after treatment is another big issue, and currently, their resistance to phagocytes and medicines is an urgent worry. To reduce the rates of morbidity and mortality linked to their use, an alternative to antibiotics and repeated procedures is needed. Both in vitro and in vivo models are now being used to study the technologies discussed in the review. With growing success in the development of effective therapies one can expect their introduction to the market in the near future.Author ContributionsConceptualization writing or original draft preparation, methodology, review, editing and validation M.E.; methodology, review, editing and validation; Z.A. and K.E. methodology, review, editing and validation B.G. methodology, supervision, review and validation T.K. and A.B.

        "abstract": "Corynebacterium rouxii is one of the recently described species of the Corynebacterium diphtheriae complex. As this species can potentially infect different hosts and harbor the tox gene, producing diphtheria toxin, we present its first pangenomic analysis in this work. A total of fifteen genomes deposited in online databases were included. After confirming the taxonomic position of the isolates by genomic taxonomy, the genomes were submitted to genomic plasticity, gene synteny, and pangenome prediction analyses. In addition, virulence and antimicrobial resistance genes were investigated. Finally, epidemiological data were obtained through molecular typing, clustering, and phylogenetic analysis. Our data demonstrated genetic diversity within the species with low synteny. However, the gene content is extensively conserved, and the pangenome is composed of 2606 gene families, of which 1916 are in the core genome and 80 are related to unique genes. Prophages, insertion sequences, and genomic islands were found. A type I-E CRISPR-Cas system was also detected. Besides the tox gene, determinants involved in adhesion and iron acquisition and two putative antimicrobial resistance genes were predicted. These findings provide valuable insight about this species\u2019 pathogenicity, evolution, and diversity.

        "content": "1. IntroductionCorynebacteriumcomprises a collection of aerobic or facultatively anaerobic, non-acid-fast, non-spore-forming, and irregular rod-shaped microorganisms with a high GC content. The type species isCorynebacterium diphtheriae, known as the main etiological agent of diphtheria, a contagious infection that can affect the respiratory tract and skin. The main signs and symptoms result from the action of diphtheria toxin (DT), an exotoxin produced by the microorganism when lysogenized by phages carrying thetoxgene [1].Despite advances resulting from universal vaccination programs with the diphtheria toxoid, which drastically reduced the number of cases worldwide, diphtheria is still reported even in immunized individuals [2,3]. In recent years, the number of cases and outbreaks of diphtheria have been reported in several countries, including Brazil, where diphtheria is endemic, as well as Austria, Belgium, France, Norway, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom [2,3,4,5,6].BesidesC. diphtheriae, the closely related speciesCorynebacterium belfantii,Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis,Corynebacterium rouxii,Corynebacterium silvaticum, andCorynebacterium ulcerans, which form theC. diphtheriaecomplex, can also harbor thetoxgene and produce DT [7,8,9].C. rouxiiwas described in 2020 based on the genomic taxonomy of six atypical maltose-negative strains, isolated from humans and one dog, previously identified asC. diphtheriaebiovar Belfanti [10]. In this same study, atypical biovar Belfanti strains isolated from cats in the USA [9] were also reclassified asC. rouxii. Considering these recent taxonomic reclassifications, some earlier names should be corrected toC. rouxii. Until this moment, the latest cases ofC. rouxiiinfection have been reported in the USA [11], Germany [12], Spain [13], and Brazil [14].In the present work, we present the first pangenomic analysis ofC. rouxii, contributing to the identification of potential virulence factors and genes related to antimicrobial resistance and a better understanding of the pathogenic potential and evolution of this recently described species ofCorynebacterium.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Genome Data Retrieval from Public DatabaseFor comparative analysis ofC. rouxii, we used the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI\u2014https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/, accessed on 12 January 2024) and the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA\u2014https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/browser/home, accessed on 14 January 2024) databases to retrieve the genomic sequences. A total of 15 genomes ofC. rouxiiwere downloaded in nucleotide FASTA format from NCBI and in text-based format FASTQ from ENA. The quality analysis of the sequences was performed using FastQC (https://github.com/s-andrews/FastQC, accessed on 21 January 2024). All genomes downloaded from ENA were assembled using Unicycler v.0.5.0 (https://github.com/rrwick/Unicycler, accessed on 21 January 2024) and contigs with less than 200 bp were trimmed. To evaluate the guanine and cytosine (GC) content, size, and fragmentation of the genomes, we used QUAST (https://github.com/ablab/quast, accessed on 22 January 2024). The completeness and contamination levels were estimated using CheckM2 (https://github.com/chklovski/CheckM2, accessed on 22 January 2024) and the completeness of rRNA genes was estimated using Barnapp (https://github.com/tseemann/barrnap, accessed on 22 January 2024). Information about the sequences is provided inTable 1. All genomes were annotated using Prokka v.1.14.6 (https://github.com/tseemann/prokka, accessed on 22 January 2024) [15].2.2. Taxonomy, Typing, and PhylogenyThe taxonomy of the strains was determined using TYGS (https://tygs.dsmz.de/, accessed on 3 February 2024). Sequence type (ST) was determined in silico considering seven housekeeping genes,atpA,dnaE,dnaK,fusA,leuA,odhA, andrpoB, according to the MLST scheme defined in PubMLST [16] and using the FastMLST script (https://github.com/EnzoAndree/FastMLST, accessed on 3 February). Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) values among theC. rouxiistrains were calculated using PyANI v.0.2.12 (https://github.com/widdowquinn/pyani, accessed on 6 February 2024). DNA-DNA hybridization (DDH) was determined in silico for the genomes using the Type (Strain) Genome Server (https://tygs.dsmz.de, accessed on 6 February 2024). Genomes were clustered using PopPUNK v.2.6.0 [17], and the network was visualized using Cytoscape v.3.10.1 [18].The phylogenetic tree based on the MLST scheme was built using OrthoFinder pipeline v.2.5.5 (https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder, accessed on 22 March 2024) with the MAFFT algorithm [19] for protein sequence alignment and FastTree (http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/, accessed on 22 March 2024) for tree inference (parameter \u201c-M msa\u201d). The tree was visualized using iTOL v.6 (https://itol.embl.de/, accessed 22 March 2024). For the wgMLSTtree, whole genome sequences were uploaded into PGAdg-builder (http://wgmlstdb.imst.nsysu.edu.tw/, accessed on 24 March 2024), and the core genes with default parameters (90% coverage and 90% identity) were chosen [20].2.3. Prediction of Mobile Genetic Elements, CRISPR-Cas Systems, and Genomic IslandsPlasmidFinder v.2.1.6 was used for the in silico detection of plasmids [21], and IntegronFinder v.2.0 was used for identifying and analyzing integrons across the genomes [22]. The prophage sequences were identified and annotated with Phage Search Tool Enhanced Release (PHASTER) [23]. Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) values were calculated among the predicted intact prophages and their closest phages using PyANI v.0.2.12. Prophage regions with ANI identity values > 95.0% were aligned using tblastx [24], and compared and visualized using the Easyfig application [25]. Moreover, the Insertion Sequences (IS) were identified using ISEScan [26]. CRISPRCasFinder v.1.1.2 was used to analyze the presence of Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs) and Cas proteins [27]. In our analyses, we included only CRISPR arrays with evidence levels equal to 3 or 4 [27], and the type of CRISPR-Cas cassette was determined following the previously described nomenclature and classification [28]. Spacer sequences were analyzed for their identity in the CRISPRTarget database [29]. Spacer hits were selected from the CRISPRTarget with a cut-off Identity Cover (IC) score above 0.80 [30].The prediction of putative genomic islands was performed using GIPSy v.1.1.2 [31], withCorynebacterium glutamicumATCC 13,032 (GenBank accession number GCA_000011325.1) as a reference for non-pathogenic closely related organism [32]. Circular genome map comparisons were built using BRIG (Blast Ring Image Generator) software v.0.95 [33], including reference positions for antimicrobial resistance genes, virulence factors, and genomic islands. Functional annotation was performed with EggNOG-mapper v.2.1.11 [34] to explore the genes in the islands.2.4. Gene SyntenyThe software Mauve v.20150226 and the progressive Mauve algorithm were used to construct multiple genome alignments, which provided information about evolutionary events such as rearrangement and inversion [35].2.5. Virulence Factors and Antimicrobial Resistance GenesVFanalyzer was implemented to screen potential virulence factors in allC. rouxiistrains using the VFDB (Virulence Factor Database) database [36]. Additionally, we used PanViTa v.1.1.3 [37] to search for antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence genes using the CARD (Comprehensive Antibiotic Resistance Database) and VFDB databases, respectively, for more accurate results. The phylogeny of thetoxgene fromC. rouxiiand other species from theC. diphtheriaecomplex was inferred from the maximum likelihood method based on the Tamura 3-parameter model using Mega v6 and bootstrap values with 1000 replicates [38].2.6. Pangenome Development and Functional AnnotationPangenomic analysis was performed with the Bacterial Pan Genome Analysis pipeline (BPGA) v.1.3, using the following options to configure the analysis: 50% identity cut-off and USEARCH as a default-clustering tool [39]. According to Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG), the coding sequences (CDS) of the core genome, accessory, and unique gene subsets were aligned and classified based on the functional categories [40]. EggNOG-mapper v.2.1.11 was used to perform the functional annotation according to orthologous genes [34]. DIAMOND v2.0.14.152 (https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond/releases, accessed on 10 March 2024) was chosen for the initial sequence-mapping step by eggNOG-mapper. The most suitable matching of sequence mapping was classified according to its taxonomy. Finally, it was categorized and annotated according to gene ontology (GO) [41], KEGG pathways [42], and COG functional categories [43], which have several categories.3. Results3.1. Taxonomy, Typing, and PhylogenyAll strains were classified asC. rouxiiby TYGS (Supplementary Table S1). Six different STs were identified: 74 (USA, cat), 181 (France, human), 537 (France, human; Spain, human), 538 (France, dog), 899 (Brazil, cat), and 918 (Brazil, dog) (Supplementary Table S2). The ANI values among strains ranged from 0.98 to 1.0 (Supplementary Figure S1). The strains formed five clusters. Four of them had the same host and country: Cluster 1 (USA, cat), Cluster 2 (France, human), Cluster 4 (Brazil, dog), and Cluster 5 (France, dog). Cluster 3 had isolates from cats in Brazil, humans in France, and humans in Spain (Supplementary Figure S2).The phylogenetic tree based on the MLST scheme showed two main clades. The first clade contained only the American strains (PC0226, PC0229, PC0230, and PC0231), while the other clade contained the Brazilian, French, and Spanish strains, composed of two main subclades. In the first one, only the French strains were clustered, as FRC0190T, FRC0284, FRC0071, and FRC0527 had more phylogenetic proximity than FRC0412. In the other subclade, we could observe that the Brazilian strains clustered and separated from the French and Spanish strains. However, 70862 and 70863 demonstrated more phylogenetic proximity with the latter than 21395 and 58111 (Figure 1). No phylogenetic difference was observed when constructing the wgMLSTtree (Supplementary Figure S3).3.2. Prediction of Mobile Genetic Elements, CRISPR-Cas Systems, and Genomic IslandsThe analysis performed with PlasmidFinder v.2.1.6 did not detect plasmids in the genomes of any strain, and IntegronFinder v.2.0 did not identify any integrons in the genomes.Using PHASTER, we predicted 57 prophage regions, which were classified into intact (n= 3), incomplete (n= 46), and questionable (n= 8). Detailed information is presented inSupplementary Table S3. A total of 25 different phages were found. The most common phage wasCorynebacteriumPoushou, present in 12 strains, followed byGordoniaGMA5 andRhodococcusSleepyhead, present in seven and five strains, respectively. Intact prophages were found in the genomes of the 58111, PC0226, and PC0231 strains. After the analysis of ANI values considering all matching regions between intact prophage regions ofC. rouxiiand the most common phages, we realized that the ANI value between PC0226 and PC0231 was 1.0, and the ANI value between PC0226 andEscherichiaphage lato was 0.99, as well as between PC0231 andEscherichiaphage lato. On the other hand, 58,111 prophages did not present identity with any of the closest phages detected by PHASTER (Supplementary Figure S4).The image generated using the Easyfig application shows the identity between the intact prophages from the PC0226 and PC0231 strains and the similar products of the genes present in these regions, such as C protein, gpA protein, minor and major spike proteins, capsid, DNA packaging, and external scaffolding proteins (Figure 2A). The gpA protein of the PC0231 prophage was found to be translocated and 1179 bases were deleted when compared with the same protein in the PC0226 prophage. On the other hand, the intact prophage from the 58111 strain, more significant than the others, presented the following products in its region: recombination, tail fiber, tail assembly, capsid decoration, phage portal major proteins, besides terminals, head maturation protease, methyltransferase, and some hypothetical proteins (Figure 2B).The prediction of insertion sequences carried out in ISEScan revealed the following numbers of elements in the genome of each strain: FRC0190T(IS = 33); FRC0071 and FRC0412 (IS = 32); 21395 and 58111 (IS = 30); FRC0284 (IS = 29); 70862 and 70863 (IS = 28); FRC0527 (IS = 27); PC0226 (IS = 26); PC0230, PC0231, and CS30 (IS = 25); and FRC0297 and PC0229 (IS = 24). The IS were grouped into seven families (IS110, IS21, IS256, IS3, IS30, IS5, and ISL3). Information about the number of IS families in each strain is inSupplementary Table S4.The CRISPRCasFinder server identified the type I-E CRISPR-Cas system, lacking thecas3 gene in all strains. A total of 13 regions related to CRISPR were detected with an evidence level equal to 4 (Supplementary Table S5). FRC0284 and CS30 were the unique strains that did not present a CRISPR system with high precision for spacer repetition and similarity. Analysis of the spacer diversity among all of the CRISPR arrays found 292 spacer sequences, in which the FRC0412 strain carried the largest number of them (70 spacers). The other strains presented the following numbers of sequences: FRC0190T(33 spacers); 21395, 58111, and FRC0071 (29 spacers); FRC0527 (22 spacers); FRC0297 (17 spacers); 70862 and 70863 (16 spacers); PC0226, PC00229, and PC0230 (8 spacers); and PC0231 (7 spacers). All spacers with values above 80% identity from the CRISPRTarget server are presented inSupplementary Table S5.Figure 3shows the similarity between FRC0190Tand the otherC. rouxiigenomes, providing comparative genomic plasticity results. The GC content was 53.81%. Considering only strong predictions, it was possible to check the presence of nine genomic islands (GI 1\u2013GI 9). We found several genes involved in biological processes: transport (ABC and serine transporter), adherence (spaD-type pili), uptake and translocation of the essential macronutrient phosphorus (phosphate transporter), iron uptake, and the siderophore biosynthesis system (ciuABCD).3.3. Gene SyntenyAfter multiple alignments between FRC0190Tand the otherC. rouxiigenomes, it was possible to visualize that, although the gene content was conserved inside the blocks, the strains presented rearrangements over large parts of the genome, including inversions and translocations. Some deletion blocks, mainly at the ends of the genomes, were also visible. These results are presented inSupplementary Figure S5.3.4. Virulence Factors and Antimicrobial Resistance GenesAs observed inFigure 4, compared to VFDB referenceC. rouxiiFRC0190T, thetoxgene was identified in four strains (PC0226, PC0229, PC0230, and PC0231), and the sequences of this gene differed from that found inC. diphtheriae,C. pseudotuberculosis,C. silvaticum, andC. ulcerans(Figure 5). Additionally, as shown inFigure 4, in all strains, except the FRC0527 strain, a complete pilus cluster (spaABC) was detected, and in the FRC0190T, 70862, 70863, FRC0297, and CS30 strains, an incompletespaDEF (onlyspaD) was detected. In all strains, genes involved in the ABC transporter, ABC-type heme transporter, and Ciu iron uptake systems were detected. All strains, except 21395, 58111, 70862, and 70863, also presented theciuD gene. FRC0297 was the unique strain in which no gene involved in a siderophore-dependent iron uptake system was detected. Some genes, such asdtxR,embC, andmptC, were also predicted in all strains, includingrpoB2 andrbpA.3.5. Pangenome Development and Functional AnnotationFor the pangenome analysis ofC. rouxii, we predicted 2606 gene families (Figure 6A), including 1916 in the core genome (73.5%), 610 related to accessory genes (23.4%), and 80 related to unique genes (3.1%). The distribution of accessory and unique genes in each strain is shown inFigure 6B. The \u03b1 value was less than 1, approximately 0.95 (\u03b1 = 1 \u2212 0.05).The distribution of COG functional classifications in the pangenome of theC. rouxiistrains showed the prevalence of several categories according to the organization of genes into core, accessory, and unique groups (Figure 7). The main COG subcategories in the core genome were amino acid transport and metabolism (10.7%); translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis (8.5%); transcription (7.0%); replication, recombination, and repair (6.7%); and inorganic ion transport and metabolism (6.5%). Accessory genes were mainly related to replication, recombination, and repair (17.6%); inorganic ion transport and metabolism (9.9%); transcription (7.8%); amino acid transport and metabolism (5.2%); and cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (5.2%). On the other hand, unique genes were mainly involved in replication, recombination, and repair (34.0%); defense mechanisms (16.5%); carbohydrate transport and metabolism (16.5%); and cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis (16.5%). A total of 204 genes presented function unknown, comprising 128 genes (6.7%) in the core genome and 76 genes (12.4%) in accessory genes (Figure 7). The functional annotation of KEGG is shown inFigure 8.4. DiscussionIn recent years, taxonomic analysis based on the genome ofC. diphtheriaestrains led to the description of the novel speciesC. belfantiiandC. rouxii[8,10]. Until now,C. rouxiihas been found to cause different infections in humans, dogs, and cats [9,10,11,12,13,14]. Although the potential to infect other host species and to produce DT is a matter of concern, few studies in the literature have focused on the virulence factors, mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance, and metabolic pathways of this species. In this sense, we performed the first pangenomic analysis of this species, providing valuable insight into its pathogenicity, evolution, and diversity.Additionally, to ensure the quality of data, the 15 strains for which their genomes were deposited in the NCBI and ENA databases were first confirmed based on dDDH and ANI values, which were consistent with values above the proposed cut-off points for species limit, corroborating identification of the strains asC. rouxii. Considering the need to obtain epidemiological data on this emerging pathogen, we also submitted the genomes to molecular typing, clustering, and phylogenetic analysis.MLST has been widely used in different countries for genotyping circulatingC. diphtheriaeandC. ulceransstrains and in investigations of diphtheria outbreaks [44,45,46]. With the description of novel species of theC. diphtheriaecomplex, the MLST scheme has also been applied to typing the isolates of these species. In our analyses, six STs could be attributed to theC. rouxiistrains. More than one ST was attributed to isolates from each host species (human, cat, and dog), showing a certain genetic diversity. No ST was found simultaneously in animal and human isolates. Moreover, ST-537 was found in two European countries, France and Spain, which alerts for a possible circulation of this ST in these countries.Classical MLST is typically based on sequences from only seven housekeeping genes; hence, this approach does not fully exploit core and accessory genomic variation. It cannot further discriminate genetically related isolates within STs [17,47]. Thus, we also performed a population analysis and clustering with PopPUNK software. In addition, we constructed a phylogenetic tree based on wgMLST to investigate the genetic diversity between our isolates and compare MLST and PopPUNK results. All of the analyses showed the genetic diversity ofC. rouxii. Although MLST and PopPUNK provided similar results, the phylogenetic analysis revealed the little greater discriminatory power and typeability of MLST. Further studies, including more isolates, should be performed to confirm this divergence. As expected, wgMLST was the optimal method for molecular subtypingC. rouxiiisolates. Considering that whole genome sequencing is not accessible in many countries, MLST appears to be a satisfactory alternative tool for epidemiological studies involving this species.It is known that bacterial adaptive evolution relies on the diversity of gene repertories of the species, which can be affected through a variety of processes, including horizontal gene transfer (HGT). In addition to gene acquisition, HGT can result in events of rearrangement and deletions, leading to remarkable changes in the genome over relatively short periods. HGT is one of the main processes responsible for acquiring virulence factors and antibiotic resistance, and it may change the pathogenic profile of bacterial species [48,49,50]. Thus, the 15 genomes used in this study were analyzed regarding the occurrence of gene duplication, rearrangements, and deletions and the presence of mobile elements, including insertion sequences and genomic islands. Verifying several rearrangement events, including inversions, translocations, and deletions, was possible.It is known that plasmids can be responsible for conferring a selective advantage to bacteria, such as antimicrobial resistance or virulence genes [51]. This can drastically change the prevalence of bacterial clones that are more virulent or multidrug-resistant, facilitating their rapid evolution and adaptation abilities [52]. Although plasmids were not detected in anyC. rouxiistrain in the present work, they were previously reported inC. diphtheriaestrains, including a 14.4 kb plasmid, pNG2, which, despite not having any important function in toxicity, can encode erythromycin resistance [53,54]. More recently, a multi-resistance plasmid (pLRPD) carrying genes related to penicillin (pbp2m,blaB), sulfamethoxazole (sul1), trimethoprim (dfrA16), erythromycin (erm), and tetracycline resistance (tetA familytet(Z)-like) was also predicted inC. diphtheriae[55].Moreover, our analyses did not identify any integron in theC. rouxiigenomes. Integrons are genetic elements that capture and incorporate gene cassettes by site-specific recombination, converting them into functional genes. They are composed of genes for integrase (int) and an adjacent recombination site (attI). Gene cassettes are not necessarily part of an integron but can be incorporated [56]. The same result was obtained in a previous study evaluating the antimicrobial resistance inC. pseudotuberculosis, and no integron was identified [57]. Differently, a recent study detected inC. diphtheriaean integron flanked by two insertion sequences (IS6100 and IS1628), comprising genes involved in the resistance to trimethoprim (dfrA16), sulfamethoxazole (sul1), chloramphenicol (cmlA), and aminoglycosides (aad1) [58]. A class 1 integron mobilized by IS6100 and carrying some of these genes (dfrA16,sul1) had already been identified in the genome of aC. diphtheriaestrain [59]. Interestingly, in the pLRPD ofC. diphtheriae, some of the antimicrobial resistance genes (dfrA16,sul1) were found in a truncated class 1 integron [55].The genome ofC. diphtheriaecomplex strains has been characterized by presenting several prophages that are an essential source of genomic plasticity in these species [60]. We identified many incomplete prophage sequences, probably due to the draft or reads sequence status of the genome data retrieved from a public database. On the other hand, we predicted two intact prophages in the 58111, PC0226, and PC0231 strains. The GC content of these prophage sequences was less than the average GC content of 53.0% ofC. rouxiigenomes, except for the 58111 strain.TheCorynebacteriumphage phi673 (GenBank accession number NC042354), predicted in the 58111 strain, belongs to theSiphoviridaefamily, and was first found as a lytic phage inC. glutamicumATCC 13,032 [61]. The prophage Entero lato (Escherichiaphage phiX174; GenBank accession number J02482.1), found in the PC0226 and PC0231 strains, belongs to theMicroviridaefamily and has a long history of use in several molecular applications [62]. It is commonly found infectingEscherichia colibut was also previously reported in ESBL-producingKlebsiella pneumoniaeisolates. Since our analyses did not show the presence of prophage-encoding resistance and virulence genes, it seems that they are not acting as vectors for disseminating these genes within our strains.Insertion sequences (IS) are simple and small mobile genetic elements found in most bacterial genomes. A particular bacterial genome can present different types of IS in a wide range of copy numbers. They can move within the genome and be horizontally transferred as part of other mobile elements, such as phages and plasmids, and they can affect the genome structure and gene expression [63,64,65]. Presently, seven IS families were found inC. rouxiigenomes (IS110, IS21, IS256, IS3, IS30, IS5 and ISL3). Among those, IS3, one of the largest IS families widely distributed in nature [66], had the highest number of copies in theC. rouxiistrains. All IS families in our strains were reported previously inCorynebacterium striatumisolates [63,66]. In this species, IS110, IS30, IS21, and especially IS3 and IS256 families were associated with antimicrobial resistance [63,66]. The association of IS families with antimicrobial resistance was also verified for otherCorynebacteriumspecies, includingC. diphtheriae(IS3) andCorynebacterium jeikeium(IS3 and IS256) [66].Genomic islands are part of the flexible bacterial gene pool that harbors genes derived from mobile elements. They often carry gene clusters with specific functions that can provide a selective advantage to the microorganism. For instance, some genomic islands encode iron-uptake systems, while others carry genes encoding antimicrobial resistance or virulence factors [49]. We investigated the presence and composition of genomic islands in theC. rouxiistrains. In the nine genomic islands predicted, several genes were found, including those encoding phage integrases and transposases, in addition to genes involved in acquiring and transporting nutrients and adherence. However, no gene related to antimicrobial resistance was found. These results suggest that genomic islands inC. rouxii, to date, can contribute to establishing and disseminating this bacterial species in the environment or a host. Still, they are not related to antimicrobial resistance.CRISPR-Cas is an essential adaptive immune system that helps bacteria and archaea cells not to be infected by phages, viruses, and other foreign genetic elements [67]. This system comprises a CRISPR cluster containing an array of short, direct repeats interspersed with spacer sequences and CRISPR-associated genes (cas) [68]. In this study, we found the type I-E CRISPR-Cas system in all strains. CRISPR-Cas systems, especially type I-E, have been reported inCorynebacteriumspecies, including those belonging to theC. diphtheriaecomplex. InC. diphtheriaestrains, besides type I-E CRISPR-Cas, types II and III have already been detected and reported [69]. Using the CRISPRTarget server, the spacer sequences of the strains matched most frequently with corynebacterial (C. diphtheriaeandC. ulcerans),Rhodococcusphages, andCorynebacteriumphage BFK20, present in the pathogenicity island ofC. pseudotuberculosisisolated from buffalo [70]. Some spacers also matched with other phages found inStaphylococcusphage phi7401PVL andPseudomonas mendocina S5.2.The production of DT after lysogenization by corynebacteriophages that harbor thetoxgene has already been verified in the speciesC. diphtheriae,C. ulcerans, andC. pseudotuberculosis[71]. For the other species forming theC. diphtheriaecomplex, there is a consideration that they are potentially toxigenic. To date, no study has demonstrated the presence of thetoxgene inC. rouxiigenomes. In our study, we detected the presence of this important gene in four strains (PC0226, PC0229, PC0230, and PC0231), all isolated from animal hosts. The sequence of thetoxgene was similar in all isolates and differed from that found inC. diphtheriae, C. pseudotuberculosis, C. silvaticum,andC. ulcerans.In agreement with a previous study, thetoxgenes isolated fromC. diphtheriaestrains had more phylogenetic proximity with those isolated fromC. ulcerans[70]. In contrast, in our research, thetoxgenes isolated fromC. rouxiihad more phylogenetic proximity withC. pseudotuberculosisandC. silvaticum. Notification of potentially toxigenic corynebacteria in animals is not mandatory in most countries; thus, epidemiological data are scarce [72]. However, the presence of thetoxgene in these species, which are already isolated from humans and animals, may advise about the risk of dissemination of diphtheria.In the present study, we detected several virulence factors for which their importance has already been demonstrated in previous studies withC. diphtheriaeand other species. TheembC andmptC genes were identified in all genomes and are related to CdiLAM, which is responsible for forming the characteristic cell envelope inC. diphtheriaestrains [73]. The gene clusterspaABC was detected in all strains, encoding the pili SpaA, which is relevant in the adherence to pharyngeal epithelial cells [74]. The surface-anchored pilus proteinspaD, involved in adherence, was found in only the FRC0190T, 70862, 70863, FRC0297, and CS30 strains.Several systems have been related to iron acquisition inC. diphtheriaeand related species, including thefagABC operon, which is associated with thefagD gene [75], theirp6 operon (irp6ABC) [76], and theciugene cluster, formed by the genesciuA,ciuB,ciuC,ciuD, andciuE [77]. Our data revealed the presence of thefagABC operon in allC. rouxiistrains. Theirp6 operon was not detected in the FRC0297 genome,ciuD in the Brazilian strains 21395, 58111, 70862, and 70863, as well asciuE, which was absent in all strains. The absence of these genes may reduce siderophore production and iron uptake.The iron acquisition from hemin byC. diphtheriaerequires the ABC-type hemin transporter, HmuTUV, and three hemin-binding proteins (HtaA, HtaB, and HtaC) [78,79]. Unlike previously observations forC. diphtheriae[80], in the present study, only thehmuTUV cluster was detected entirely in all genomes, suggesting a decreased ability to use hemin as the sole iron source. We detected thedtxR gene in all strains, which encodes DtxR, a protein involved in the regulation of DT expression and the synthesis and production of siderophore, besides regulating some other promoters [81]. In addition, DtxR and iron regulate a complex network of genes involved in iron metabolism, including the operonirp6 and theciugene cluster [82].As presented inFigure 3, the genesrbpA andrpoB2, previously associated with rifampin resistance [55,83,84,85,86], were predicted in all genomes. However, additional studies are needed to demonstrate how this resistance occurs inCorynebacteriumspecies.Across the 15 genomes, we identified a pangenome composed of 2606 gene families, of which 1916 were in the core genome, 610 were in the accessory genome, and 80 were related to unique genes. When \u03b1 < 1.0, the pangenome is considered open, which means its size will continuously increase when adding new genomes. In contrast, when \u03b1 > 1, the pangenome is considered closed, meaning that no substantial number of extra genes can be added to the pangenome [87,88]. Our analysis found an alpha value less than 1 (0.95), indicating an open pangenome near to being closed as genes are added. Moreover, there was considerable variation in the number of unique genes, where some strains had more genes, being more variable than others. For example, FRC0190Thad 28 unique genes, while PC0226, PC0229, PC0230, and PC0231 did not have any exclusive genes. It is important to emphasize that the number of genomes in this study was not large, and the composition of the pangenome can change as more genomes are sequenced. Since the first description of theC. rouxiistrain in 2020, a relatively small number of genomes of this species has been sequenced thus far compared to other related ones belonging to theC. diphtheriaecomplex. So, when comparing theC. rouxiiandC. silvaticumpangenomes, we noticed that they had similar alpha values, in which some studies have shown values between 0.95 and 0.97 for the latter species [84,89]. Moreover, core genome and singleton analyses agreed with this clonal-like behavior in other complex species. They can also be inferred from pangenome data, in whichC. pseudotuberculosis, C. ulcerans, andC. diphtheriaehad alpha values of 0.89, 0.81, and 0.69, with pangenomes composed of 54%, 40%, and 34% core genes families, respectively [89,90,91].The distribution of COG showed a high percentage of genes related to replication, recombination, repair, transcription, and amino acid transport and metabolism in the core and accessory genomes of theC. rouxiipangenome. This finding was similar to the results reported for theC. silvaticumandC. ulceranscore genomes [91]. However, regarding the accessory genome inC. ulcerans, most genes were involved in translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis; lipid and inorganic ion transport and metabolism; and post-translational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones. Most of the differences were found when theC. rouxiiandC. diphtheriaecore genomes were compared, mainly because the latter was composed of genes related to the cell wall, membrane, and envelope biogenesis; carbohydrate transport and metabolism; and nucleotide transport and metabolism [92]. Regarding the accessory genome inC. diphtheriae, genes were mainly involved in transporting and metabolizing carbohydrates, lipids, and inorganic ions [93].These findings are relevant for future studies focusing on the search for resistance and virulence genes. They contribute to different areas, including vaccinology and epidemiology. However, they should be corroborated through in vitro and in vivo experimentation.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at:https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/bacteria3020007/s1, Table S1: DDH in silico results obtained by the Type Strain Genome Server forC. rouxiistrains compared to the closest related type strain; Table S2: Information about the Multilocus Sequence Typing forC. rouxiistrains; Table S3: Information about the prophage regions found in theC. rouxiigenomes; Table S4: Number of predicted IS families in eachC. rouxiistrain; Table S5: Hits found to spacer sequences in the CRISPRTarget databases; Figure S1: Heatmap representing the ANI percentage nucleotide identity of all matching regions betweenC. rouxiigenomes using PyANI v.0.2.12.; Figure S2: Clusters ofC. rouxiistrain genomes generated using PopPUNK v.2.6.0; Figure S3: The wgMLST tree based on genomes fromC. rouxiistrains using PGAdb-builder; Figure S4: Heatmap representing the ANI percentage nucleotide identity of all matching regions between intact prophage regions ofC. rouxiiand the most common phages using PyANI v.0.2.12; Figure S5: Gene synteny analysis using the software Mauve.Author ContributionsStudy design, analysis and interpretation of data, and article writing: F.D.P.

IntroductionThe origin of the \u2018Microbial World\u2019 dates back to the early 1900s, when the coexistence of a vast number of microorganisms, including bacteria, yeasts, and viruses, was reported on various sites on the human body and in and around its surroundings [1]. Microorganisms are ubiquitously found in soil, water, and air, including space [2]. The human and microbial world go hand in hand, and the human microbiome is often referred to as \u2018the hidden organ\u2019, which contributes over 150 times more genetic information than that of the entire human genome [3]. Recent advances in sequencing have enabled genome sequencing of the microorganisms and thus their understanding [4]. The composition of the microbiome varies from environment to environment and from site to site in the human body [5]. In the current review, our goal is to comprehensively focus on how the microbial world influences human lives in health and well being (Figure 1). Additionally, we provide a comprehensive overview of microorganisms of agricultural importance, biopesticides, biofertilizers, and nitrogen fixation, providing detailed accounts of PGPR (plant growth-promotingRhizobacteria). We also discuss air, water, and soil pollution with regard to the microbial world. Then, we present a detailed account of microbial applications in the food industry and pharmaceutical industry. Furthermore, we discuss various probiotics and how they influence mental and reproductive health in human beings. As this is a very dynamic and diverse area of research, there is a significant requirement for advanced technologies, such next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics approaches, to completely understand the microbiome and how it influences human lives in different ways.2. Beneficial Bacteria of Agricultural ImportanceMicrobes are tiny structures that are difficult to visualize with the naked eye and have variability starting from micrometers to millimeters in length. However, their small unicellular structures act as machinery for the production of several compounds that provides several benefits in the agricultural sector. Sometimes, their whole cells are also as useful as products in practical applications. Some of the frequent and paramount aspects of bacteria in the agricultural field are discussed here (Figure 1).2.1. Decomposition of Organic MattersThe decomposition of organic materials is a fundamental ecological phenomenon in which nature recycles nutrients into the lithosphere and biosphere [6,7]. The conversion of soluble substances, like sugars and nitrogenous products, is the preliminary choice for conversion since they serve as the predominant energy source for bacteria [8]. They mainly turn into aliphatic acids (acetic, formic, etc.), hydroxy acids (citric, lactic, etc.), or alcohols (ethyl alcohol, etc.) by different groups of bacteria by simple oxidation processes. The decomposition of insoluble complex substances, like cellulose, which is broken down mostly into cellobiose and glucose, is further converted into organic acids [9]. Hemicellulose is broken down into component sugars and uranic acid, which are further metabolized to pentose and carbon dioxide [10,11]. Pectin is broken down into galacturonan or rhamnogalacturonan [12]. Lignin is broken down into hydroxy cinnamyl alcohols (or monolignols), coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol, p-coumaryl alcohol [13]. Starch is broken down into glucose via amylose and amylopectin [14,15], xylan into xylose [8], chitin into n-acetyl D glucosamine and then fructose 6 phosphate [11], keratin into simple amino acid molecules [16], lipids into fatty acids and glycerol [17], and many more.2.2. Soil Fertility/PGPRThe upper surface or crust of our earth is a breathing element continuously recycling nutrients, minerals, gases, and all kinds of life forms, which also aid the base for plants [18]. PGPR is an emerging group of organisms responsible for enhancing the growth and bodily functions of terrestrial autotrophs, viz., plants [19]. The direct PGPR machinery involves the fixation of molecular N2, the production of siderophores, the mineralization of inorganic phosphates, the solubilization of potassium, and the production of growth hormones beneficial to the plants, whereas the indirect PGPR involves the secretion of antibiotics, the production of HCN, the release of hydrolytic enzymes, polysaccharide accumulation, and induced systemic resistance [19,20]. For example, a recent study identified two novel biofilm-forming PGPR strains,Bacillus subtilis-FAB1 andPseudomonas azotoformans-FAP3, which resulted in improved growth and productivity of wheat under drought conditions [21,22]. Similar encouraging results were found in corn using PGPR mix formulation, which mainly comprised differentBacillussp. [23]. In an earlier study,Dyadobactersp. was used to enhance the growth of legumes and finger millets by fixing atmospheric N2and making it more available to plants [24,25].When it comes to the demand of the growing population, an increase in population, decrease in agricultural land area, an increase in seasonal variations and different biotic and abiotic stresses which have brough down the food production annually are the most concerning factors. [19]. The emerging needs of microbes focus on PGPR as a boon in the agriculture sector that can increase the productivity and disease control in plants [21]. Beneficial free-living bacteria in soil are referred to as PGPR or yield-increasing bacteria (YIB) by one group of workers in China [22,26]. Currently, PGPR as a bioinoculant in sustainable farming practices has received greater attention [23]. PGPR stimulates plant growth through several mechanisms, either directly by supplying plants with phytohormones, phosphate solubilization, nitrogen fixation, and siderophore production, or indirectly by protecting plants from phytopathogens through different mechanisms [23]. The group of PGPR includes bacteria belonging to different genera, such asAcinetobacter,Agrobacterium,Arthobacter,Azobacter,Azospirillum,Burkholderia,Bradyrhizobium,Rhizoobium,Frankia,Serratia,Thiobacillus,Pseudomonads, andBacillus[19,21].2.2.1. PGPR by Phytohormone ProductionMany PGPR are well known to secrete hormones and manipulate hormone balance in the plants to boost growth and stress response, which finally regulate root/shoot growth [27]. The hormones involved mostly include auxins, cytokinins, and ethylene and, to a lesser extent, gibberellins and abscisic acid [28].Auxin Producing PGPRPatten and Glick (1996) reported that around 80% of PGPR possess the ability to produce indole acetic acid (IAA) [29]. Indole acetic acid plays a vital role in the growth and developmental aspects of plants, such as the development of vascular tissues, lateral root formation, cell differentiation, apical dominance, etc. [29]. Two strains,Pseudomonas fluorescens(M4) andSerratia proteamaculans(M11), have shown 13.26 \u00b5g/mL and 19.19 \u00b5g/mL auxin production in presence of L-tryptophan, which showed an increase in plant height by 45%, fresh biomass by 56%, total chlorophyll content by 29%, total phenolic content by 59 to 73%, phosphorus content by 26%, potassium content by 50%, and protein content by 27% [30]. Similarly, a substantial increment in straw yield, cob length, cob weight, grain weight, and grain yield were recorded with inoculation of the Bacillus strain. IAA production with tryptophan was 57\u2013288 \u00b5g/mL byPseudomonas aeruginosa(CMG860), and the root elongation of germinating seeds and shoot lengths was the highest when inoculated with CMG860 [29]. IAA production byAzosprillum brasilense(DSM1690) is reported to be 32\u00b5g/mL. The maximum grain yield (13.8 g/plant) was seen when inoculated with isolate S54 [29,30].Cytokinin-Producing PGPRCytokinins influence plant growth and development by cell division, the expansion of leaves, delaying leaf senescence, etioplast conversion to chloroplast, and chloroplast accumulation in leaves [31]. Cytokinins are plant hormones and in one of the research projects, it was found that wheat plants inoculated withAzospirillum brasilense(RA17) showed increased plant height, crop growth rate, relative growth rate, net assimilation rate, and leaf area index during different developmental stages of the plant [28,31]. It also showed an increase in proline content, endogenous hormones, and antioxidant enzyme activity in wheat kernels. Other physiological parameters like epicuticular wax, stomatal conductance, the photosynthetic rate, and chlorophyll contents were also found to improve [28].Bacillus megaterium(UMCV1) increased root and shoot fresh weight in wild-typeArabidopsis thaliana[32]. One of the studies reveal that the AK1 strain ofPseudomonas fluorescensincreased isopentanyl adenosine (IPA), dihydroxyzeatin riboside (DHZR), and zeatin riboside (ZR) production with time in pure cultures, i.e., at 12 h 2.1 pmol/mL and at 336 h 5.5 pmol/mL IPA at 96 h 0.2 pmol/mL, at 336 h 1.38 pmol/mL of DHZR, at 72 h 2.5 pmol/mL, and at 336 h 3.1 pmol/mL ZR. Inoculation with root exudates at 5.9 pmol/mL IPA and 2.6 pmol/mL ZR showed no significant difference in DHZR in treated and untreated plants [33]. The free-living bacteriaPaenibacillus polymyxaproduced isopentenyladenine during its stationary phase of growth [34].ACC-Producing PGPREthylene is a gaseous hormone that causes senescence and fruit ripening in plants [35]. 1-Aminocyclopropane 1-carboxylic acid (ACC) is a direct precursor of ethylene biosynthesis [36]. PGPR-producing ACC deaminase promotes plant growth by lowering plant ethylene levels. The inoculation of Glutamicibacter (YD01) species had the ability to produce ACC deaminase and had shown increased shoot height, root length, fresh weight, and dry weight, and enhanced salt tolerance in rice [37].Brevibacterium iodinum(RS16),Bacillus licheniformis(RS656), andZhihengliuela alba(RS111) have been shown to reduce ethylene production by 57%, 44%, and 53%, which helped in to reduce salt stress in red pepper plants [38].Methylobacterium fujisawaensepromoted root elongation in canola [39].Pseudomonassp. andBradyrhizobiumsp. enhanced nodulation in mung beans [40] andPseudomonas plecoglossicidastrain Pp20 plant photosynthesis in maize plants under saline stress [38].PGPR-Producing SiderophoresSiderophores are low molecular weight iron chelating compounds synthesized by many bacteria, which form complexes with free iron [41]. These molecules are encoded by five genes in operon [41,42]. In addition, siderophore has applications in clinical, environmental fields, and phytoremediation [41]. Siderophore-producing bacteria have been shown to induce metal tolerance in plants [43]. Studies in Indian mustard have shown thatBacillus edaphicusstimulated plant growth, facilitated soil Pb mobilization, and enhanced Pb accumulation [35,44].Streptomyces tendaeF4 promoted plant growth, facilitated soil metal solubilization, and enhanced Cd and Fe uptake in sunflowers [45].Streptomyces acidiscabies E13protected plants from metal toxicity and enhanced the uptake of Al, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, and U in cowpeas [46]. Presently, 500 siderophores are reported from selected microorganisms. A great variation is seen in the siderophore structure from one species to another [41].PGPR with Antifungal PropertiesPGPR, having antifungal properties, can be used as bio-fungicides and to minimize yield loss and maximize crop productivity [47]. The plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria OUG38 strain has shown a high level of inhibition againstColletotrichum capscici(80%)andRhizoctonia solani(76%), and OUG61 has shown a high level of inhibition againstFusarium oxysporum(78%) andMacrophomina phaseolena(78%).Pseudomonas aeruginosa(B7-1, B11-5, B3-, Rh-1, Rh-2) andPseudomonas putida(B53) showed antifungal activity againstFusarium oxysporum[48,49,50]. Bacillus (Bac10) has shown the highest antifungal activity againstMacrophomina, whileAzotobacter(Azt12) has shown the highest antagonistic activity againstHelminthosporiumsp., and (Azt6) againstFusariumsp.Azotobacter(WR7) showed maximum inhibition againstRhizoctonia solaniin wheat [49,51].Phosphate Solubilizing PGPRPhosphorus is the second most critical macronutrient after nitrogen required for the metabolism, growth, and development of plants [52]. Despite its abundance, it is mostly unavailable to plants [21]. The application of phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms in the soil is a promising approach to restoring soil health [53]. The solubilization index shown by Lysinibacillus pakistanensis (PCPSMR15) is 4.0 [54]. Mung beans inoculated with PCPSMR15 brought remarkable enhancement in the root (3.1 cm), stem (20.8 cm), and leaf (2.9 cm) length, as well as the control at 1.3 cm, 7.1 cm, and 1.6 cm, respectively [54,55]. Qualitative analysis reports that the phosphate solubilizing efficiency shown by the Bacillus subtilis strain 3 (PS4) is the highest, i.e., 50.9 and 10.22 \u00b5g/mL [56]. There is a diversity of phosphate-solubilizing microorganisms in the soil, which are nowadays used as biofertilizers [54]. The number of published articles on PSB from 2002 to 2022 is 1% to 13%. According to data obtained from the Web of Science (WOS) database, a total of 67 countries are involved in the publication of the topic on PSB, among which, 15 countries showed the highest number of publications, and there are 225 institutions involved in research [57]. Although PSB research is abundant, the isolation, identification, and selection of PSB strains have not yet been successfully commercialized; thus, the application is still found to be limited [21,28,58].2.3. Nitrogen FixationNitrogen is a significant component used for autotrophs and heterotrophs offered in assorted redox conditions, and its regulation for transport and assimilation might vary significantly, depending on the organism\u2019s nature [59]. There is an unmet demand for nitrogen fertilizer to fulfill the requirement of nitrogen in agriculture. However, we do not have any options left but to depend on nature and microbes to fix them spontaneously. These biological fixations could be either symbiotic, free living, or associative in nature [25]. Numerous efforts have been made to make engineered plants that can directly fix nitrogen or enter an association with microbes (e.g., making non-leguminous plants compatible with symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria). However, the results are still not promising enough to be introduced on a large scale to date [24,60]. In a recent study, bacterium, likeRhodobacter sphaeroides, can be seen fixing nitrogen along with the microalgae strainCoelastrellasp. in a mutual nutrient exchange understanding [61]. On the other hand, novel free-living bacteria, likeFundidesulfovibrio magnetotacticus, have been reported recently in rice fields capable of fixing significant amounts of nitrogen [62]. Newer approaches, like the isolation of plant tissue extract and subsequent 16\u2009S rRNA gene profiling for total culture-independent bacterial microbiome revealing newer species, are capable of fixing nitrogen in association with plants, except for the formation of legumes [14].2.4. As BiofertilizersBiofertilizers are predominantly live organisms or their products and can be used to enhance the nutrient attributes of soil, thus improving its health and productivity. Biofertilizers can be bacteria, fungi, algae, or cyanobacteria, helping to recuperate the fertility of soil via mineral and organic matter recycling. However, biosafety trials with bacteria as bio-stimulants and biofertilizers should be based on bioassays rather than taxonomy [63]. Bacteria used as major biofertilizers include nitrogen fixers (as discussed in the previous section), cyanobacteria, phosphate, and potassium solubilizers. Proven nitrogen fixer biofertilizer bacteria may include but are not limited toRhizobiumsp.,Bradyrhizobiumsp.,Streptomyces griseoflavus,Bacillus subtilis,Bacillus pumilus,Bacillus licheniformis,Kelbsiella pneumoniae,Azotobacter,Azospirillum,Nostoc,Anabaena, and many more [22,43,64,65]. Phosphate solubilizers showing great potential as biofertilizers may include but are not limited toPseudomonas fluorescens,Sphingobacterium suaedae,Bacillus pimilus,Bacillus cereus,Bacillus endophyticus,Bacillus sphaericus,Bacillus megaterium,Virgibacillussp., andEnterobacter aerogenes[21,53,58,66]. Potassium solubilizer bacteria are sometimes put under PGRP; however, their great potential might lead to them being prospective candidates in the biofertilizer market soon. A few important potassium solubilizing bacteria arePseudomonas fluorescens,Pseudomonas putida,Enterobactersp.,Bacillus megaterium,Bacillus firmus,Pantoeaagglomeran,Bacillus pseudomycoides, andBacillus cereus[67,68].2.5. As BiopesticidesBiopesticides are naturally derived substances from animals, plants, bacteria, or certain minerals that can control pest infestation in an ecofriendly manner, whereas chemical pesticides have always been a concern for the environment, as they are recalcitrant xenobiotics and are prone to bioaccumulation and biomagnification [69]. Several bacteria have been reported to produce a lethal toxin capable of controlling pests, but they are nontoxic and nonpathogenic to animals and humans [69].Bacillus thuringiensis, a Gram-positive, spore-forming soil organism, was first identified in the early 20th century in Japan and was commercialized as a biopesticide in the late 1930s in France [64]. The most widely studied and applied strains forBacillus thuringiensisare kurstaki, galeriae, and dendrolimus, which secrete \u2018Cry\u2019 protein as an endotoxin; the gastrointestinal enzymes present in the gut of different insect larvae can activate the toxin, thus leading to subsequent gut paralysis and death of the insect [70,71]. Other agriculturally important bacteria used as biopesticides include (but are not limited to) cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) producingBacillus velezensis[72]; hydrogen sulfide producingPseudoxanthomonas indica[73]; andAgrobacterium radiobacter(nowRhizobium rhizogenes), which produce agrocin, an antibiotic capable of controlling Crown Gall disease caused byAgrobacterium tumefaciens[74].Pseudomonas aeruginosais capable of producing shenqinmycin, an antifungal agent [75].Pseudomonas fluorescensis capable of producing phenazine and others [33,76].3. Bacteria: The Natural Scavenger of Environmental PollutantsRising contamination in the lithosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere imposes a severe threat to public health and safety not only in underdeveloped countries but also in industrialized developing or developed countries, such as The United States of America, the European Union, China, and India [77]. The last few decades have shed some light on the eradication of contaminants from the soil, water, or air catalytic activities of microorganisms\u2014specifically bacteria rather than relying solely on chemical methods [46]. Additionally, the inception of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the early 1980s has extended the opportunity to degrade or remove certain compounds, thus improving the scope for bacterial bioremediation [78].3.1. In Water Pollution ControlContamination of water has become a global concern, as major sources for such pollution are from the agricultural revolution (producing herbicides, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers), the industrial revolution (producing synthetic dyes, oil and grease, metals, chlorinated solvents, and toxic sludge), and the healthcare revolution (producing radioactive element and antibiotics), which are inevitable for the thriving of human civilization [79]. In 2018, fluoride was removed from water by nanoparticles synthesized usingBacillus subtilisas a microbial agent [80]. A study by Wan et al. showed that heterotrophic (ThaueraandFerritrophicum) and autotrophic bacteria (Chlorobaculum) can be useful for removing perchlorate and nitrate from water [81]. Various studies for synthetic dye (such as Malachite Green, Congo Red, Direct Green, Bromophenol Blue, Acid Red, Basic Blue, and many more) removal from water have been performed previously, which revealed that physicochemical parameters might be a crucial factor influencing removal percentage from aqueous solutions [4,82,83,84]. Recent studies have shown bacteria\u2019s ability to remove antibiotics [85], chemical fertilizers [86], herbicides [78], pesticides [79], radioactive elements [87], oil and grease [88], and many more from water [89].3.2. In Air Pollution ControlAir pollution is generally regarded as the admixture of harmful elements generated via any anthropogenic activity or natural sources, leading to ~4 million premature mortalities every year [90]. The principal causes behind air pollution are alleged to be PM2.5(particles whose diameter is less than 2.5 mm), as these can infiltrate the respiratory, cardiovascular, and circulatory systems, thus leading to several diseases, including cancer [90,91]. As per research data, the most susceptible groups affected by air pollution are pregnant women, adolescents, and elderly people in terms of their physical and mental health [91]. Moreover, flue gases such as CO, NO, SO2, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), dioxin, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) generated by combustion of fuels and flammable substances are equally poisonous to humans. Biofiltration is an emergent practice and is being used to remove air pollutants discharged by different industries. Several bacteria are being reported as competent biological agents to be used in biofilters to remove air pollutants [92]. In 2017, Bravo et al. exploited a non-culturable microbial community in an anaerobic bioscrubber and found thatMethanosaetasp.,Methanospirillumsp., Methanobacterium sp.,Geobactersp., andPelobactersp. are predominant while removing volatile organic compounds (VOCs) [93]. In another study, three proteobacteria, viz.,Thioalkalimicrobium cyclicum,Stappiasp., andOchrobactrumsp., were predominantly found in bioscrubbers and were successfully involved in the desulfurization of biogas [94]. A recent study showed thatThiobacillussp. can act as a better denitrifying agent in anaerobic conditions, whereasCryseobacteriumand unclassifiedXanthomonadaceaecan work as efficient sulfide oxidizing agents under aerobic conditions in bioscrubbers [95].3.3. In Soil Pollution ControlSoil is a natural compound that mainly forms the loose surface of the earth and principally consists of five elements\u2014minerals, organic matter, living microbes, gases, and water [40]. Among them, soil minerals are predominantly categorized into clay, silt, and sand, which vary in percentage to make different types of soil in general [14]. Rapid industrialization and the agricultural revolution continuously produce unusual environmental contaminants, like hydrocarbons, heavy metals, synthetic dyes, microplastics, and pesticides, whose cytotoxic and genotoxic effects are well known along with their non-biodegradability and advanced persistence [70,96,97]. Zhang et al., 2019, showed that the immobilization of bacterial cells in natural biochar can enhance the bioremediation of petroleum hydrocarbons from soil and has a potential for application in ex situ bioremediations [97]. A range of bacteria likeAcinetobacter baumannii,Bacillus weihenstephanensis,Pseudomonas aeruginosa,Pseudomonas fluorescens, andRhodococcus rubercan be useful for the biodegradation of microplastic and nanoplastic residues from the soil via biodeterioration, biofragmentation, assimilation, and mineralization [98]. Reports suggest that several bacteria such asBacillus,Klebsiella,Mycobacterium,Pandoraea,Pseudomonas,Sphingomonas,Sphingopyxis,Rhodococcus,Sphingobium, andPhanerochaete chrysosporiumare involved in the bioremediation of pesticide-contaminated soil, thus controlling soil toxicity and nutrient recycling [99]. However, an integrated approach may be taken among microbiological methods linked with field application design so that genetically modified or engineered microbial stains can be developed, achieving a more effective in situ and ex situ bioremediation of hazardous waste from the soil using recombinant bacterial cells [100].4. Microbial Applications in the Food IndustryThe contemporary food system depends on unsustainable practices and often fails to meet the food demand of a rapidly growing population [101]. Hence, there is an urgent demand for novel sustainable food systems and processes [63,101]. Microorganisms have gained significant attention as a new nutrition source owing to their low carbon footprints, low reliance on land and water, and seasonal variations coupled with a favorable nutrition profile [102]. With the emergence of new tools in synthetic biology, the use of microbes has expanded, showing tremendous potential to meet our global food requirement/demand [103]. Here, we present a detailed account of various applications of microbes in food, and we cover both the use of microbes to produce whole food out of their biomass and as cell factories in making highly functional and nutritional biomolecules.4.1. Fermented Dairy ProductsThe fermentation of dairy products is accomplished through a diverse group of microbes. Along with the wide-range commercial production of fermented dairy products, the usage of starter and adjunct culture(s) has also gained application in the last century [104]. In recent years, severe investigations have also been carried out on the health benefits being conferred by various dairy products. Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains remove anti-nutritional factors, like lactose and glucose, from dairy products through their fermentative action [105]. The lactic acid bacteria develop flavor and texture and acidify milk through their proteolytic activities [106]. Some studies have demonstrated that kefir consumption has been found to have a positive impact on the metabolism and mineral density of bones [107]. Likewise, the consumption of yogurt is associated with a lower threat of type 2 diabetes [108]. The use of fermented milk products containingBifidobacterium lactisCNCM I-2494 demonstrated a positive effect on the tolerance of a plant-based diet in patients with disorders in gut\u2013brain interactions [109]. The most common starter cultures of Gram-positive lactic acid bacteria that are widely used areStreptococcus thermophilus,Lactobacillus helveticus,Lactobacillus lactis, andLactobacillus delbruckiisubsp.bulgaricus. Some of these strains also help in the preservation of fermented milk by producing bacteriocins [110]. Some specific lactic acid bacteria, likeFructilactobacillus,Lacticaseibacillus,Lactiplantibacillus,Lactobacillus,Lactococcus,Lactobacillus, Lentilactobacillus,Leuconostoc,Limosilactobacillus,Pediococcus,Streptococcus,Weissellasp., etc., synthesize exopolysaccharides (EPSs) that impart desirable physical properties to fermented dairy products [103].4.2. Fermented Non-Dairy Products Based on Cereal and VegetablesAround the world, the consumption of fermented cereals and vegetables constitutes a significant part of the human diet, with a substantial contribution to the food supply chain for a constantly growing world population [111]. Several different species of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) prevail in various fermented vegetables, depending on raw materials and environmental and physiochemical conditions during fermentation. Most predominant species in table olives areLactobacillus pentosusandLactobacillus plantarum[112]. Kimchi, a traditional South Korean fermented product, is made from cabbages, radish, and other vegetables and containsWeissellaandLeuconostoc, along withPediococcus, which is the predominant species [111]. Sauerkraut, a fermented food product made from cabbage, containsLactobacillusandLeuconostocas the dominant species during the early and middle/late stages of its fermentation.Streptococcus\u00a0malefermentanswas also found to play an important role in sauerkraut fermentation when carried out at lower temperatures [113]. During the production of pickled cucumbers,Pediococcus ethanolidurans,Enterococcus thailandicus, and diverse species of the genusLactobacillusandLeuconostocplay a key role in the fermentation process [14,114].In cereal fermentations, a key role is played byBacillusandLactobacillusspecies by hydrolyzing complex polyphenols to simpler and biologically active forms.Lactobacillus plantarumandSaccharomyces cerevisiaeplay a significant role in the fermentation of wheat noodles, affecting the structure and flavor. A significant effect was seen in the enhanced continuity of the gluten network and pore formation [14]. Many fermented food products made from cereals, like Akamu/ogi and Uji, a thin maize gruel, and ting, a fermented porridge, are used in African countries. LAB strains are mostly used in the fermentation of cereals but are sometimes mixed with the inoculum of other organisms likeCandidaspp.,Saccharomyces cerevisiae,Streptococcusspp., andAcetobacterspp. [115].4.3. In Industrial BreweriesAcetic acid bacteria have been associated with the production of vinegar and other fermented beverages [102].A. pasteurianus,A. aceti,Komagataeibacter xylinus,K. europaeus, andK. hanseniiare commonly used in vinegar production.K. xylinus,A. pasteurianus,K. hansenii,A. aceti,Gluconacetobacter saccharivorans,Acetobacter,Gluconobacter, andGluconacetobacterspp. are involved in the production of a fermented beverage, kombucha [93,110].Acetobacter lovaniensis,Acetobacter fabarum,Acetobacter cerevisiae,A. aceti,Acetobacter ghanensis,A. lovaniensis/fabarum, andAcetobacter siceraeare the predominant species during fermentation of water kefir [24].A. lambiciandG. cerevisiaeare the significant species associated with the fermentation of lambic beer [4]. A study has demonstrated thatLactobacillus fermentumKKL1 exerts a substantial effect and enhances functional aspects during the preparation of haria, a rice-based beverage consumed by ethnic people of Central and Eastern India [116]. Cheka, Keribo, Borde, Areki, Tella, Shamita, Booka, and Korefe are some of the Ethiopian indigenous fermented beverages produced from several kinds of cereal. During the preparation of these beverages, lactic acid bacteria (LAB)speciesandAcetobacter speciesplay a significant role in enhancing their organoleptic and nutritional properties and improving their bio-preservation [117]. Cauim (Kawi) is a non-alcoholic beverage of South American origin prepared from several substrates like banana, cotton seeds, maize, pumpkin, rice, cassava, etc. Lactic acid bacteria are the dominant species and play a significant role during cauim preparation. Among LAB,Lactobacillus pentosusandLactobacillus plantarumare the most prevalent species. A few species ofBacillusare also present in small amounts [118]. Wine malolactic fermentation is carried out byLactobacillus hilgardii[119].4.4. In the Meat Industry and Related ProductsCarnobacterium piscicola,C.divergens,Lactobacillus\u00a0sakei,L. curvatus,L. plantarum,Leuconostoc mesenteroides,Le. Gelidum, andLe. carnosumare the natural strains of LAB present in meat and meat products. In fresh meat, LAB are responsible for mild fermentation changes without affecting organoleptic properties [120]. The bacteriocins (proteinaceous toxins) produced by many bacteria can inhibit the growth of other bacteria in meat and meat products, e.g., the bacteriocin produced byPediococcus acidilacticiinhibits the growth ofL. monocytogenesin meat products stored under refrigerated conditions for about 28 days [4]. Likewise, bacteriocins of the genusLactobacillushave shown antimicrobial effects against severalSalmonellasps., such as Enteritidis,Heidelberg,Newport, andTyphimurium[4]. The bacteriocin nisin produced byLactobacillus lactishas a positive effect on meat bio-preservation [120].Lactobacillus sakeiand L. curvatus are the main producers of bacteriocins among the LAB present in meat and meat products and produce sakacins and curvacins, respectively [121]. Studies have shown that a combination of garlic extract with Lactobacillus reuteri and L. plantarum from beef is known to inhibit Listeria monocytogenes by the production of antibacterial agents [122]. In beef sausage, bacteriocinogenic strains ofEnterococcus mundtii, along with curing agents (3% sodium chloride, 0.02% sodium nitrate, 0.0075% ascorbic acid, 0.75% glucose and sucrose), have shown an inhibitory effect onListeria monocytogenes[123]. Pediocin secreted byPediococcus pentosaceusand extract fromMurraya koenigiiberries were demonstrated to reduce the growth ofListeria innocuain goat meat emulsion [124]. Fermented meat products like Arabic sausage, lean pork, and shrimp paste contain bacterial strains ofLactobacillus alimentarius,L. pentosus,L. plantarum,L. versmoldensis,Pediococcus acidilactici,P. pentosaceu,Stolephorus species, andSardinella species, which help in the flavoring of meat products and increase their shelf life [125,126].4.5. As ProbioticsLactobacillus,Enterococcus,Streptococcus,Pediococcus, andLeuconostocare some of the genera oflactic acid bacteriaused as probiotics in the intestine [127]. Apart from these, some stains of genera Bacillus and bacteriaAkkermansia muciniphilaareandFaecalibacterium prausnitziihave also been recognized as potential sources of probiotics [128]. Commercial probiotics food, e.g., BIO\u00ae, Actimel\u00ae, LC1\u00ae, and Yakult\u00ae, contain lactic acid bacterial strainsLactobacillus caseiandLactobacillus acidophilus. Probiotics enhance the nutritive value of food, improving the test. The fermented food doenjang/soybean paste contains bacterial strains ofBacillusspecies,Tetragenococcus, andZygosaccharomyces, acting as probiotics. These bacterial strains enhance the activity of natural killer (NK) cells of the spleen. They can also improve the inhibitory effect of bioactive peptides on the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) [129]. Fermented food products, like glutinous rice, tapioca, idli\u2013dosa, kimchi, natto, sauerkraut, vinegar, etc., containLactobacillusthat impart several health beneficiary effects, such as mitigating constipation and stimulating the human immune system. They also have antioxidant, antihypertensive, and anti-diabetic properties [4]. Studies have demonstrated that the introduction of antigens inside the human body along with probiotic bacteria can provide an effective means to attenuate autoimmune diseases, as this leads to the simultaneous suppression of both antibody and cell-mediated immune responses [130]. Some riboflavin-producing lactic acid bacteria strains, e.g.,Lactobacillus plantarum, have also displayed probiotic traits. These are appealing from an industrial perspective as multifunctional adjunct cultures for the production of biofortified fermented edibles, and they exercise probiotic characteristics [119].4.6. In the Pharmaceutical, Nutraceutical, and Cosmeceutical IndustriesMany lactic acid bacteria possess beneficial properties of being, antagonistic, antioxidant, and antimicrobial, and they also have immunomodulatory properties [111]. So, they are widely used in the pharmaceutical industry. Bacteriocins produced by several bacteria, including LAB, are widely used in food processing industries [121,131]. Due to their promising anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-cancer nature, these bacterial products are further studied for their use in the pharmaceutical and medical fields [110]. Several metabolites secreted by strains ofLactobacillus,Enterococcus, andLactococcushave shown anti-proliferative impacts on distinct cancer cell lines by the induction of apoptosis [121,132]. Microbial by-products produced byS. epidermidisare known to inhibit the colonization of pathogenicStaphylococcus aureusresponsible for several clinical conditions [133,134].Nutraceuticals are natural compounds and have the properties of chemoprotection, antioxidation, and anti-inflammation, and they are derived from food or are part of the food [135]. A high-value bread was obtained with the fermentation of barley sourdough using thePediococcus acidilacticiLUHS29 strain that was immobilized in apple pomace [15]. It showed variable carbohydrate metabolism and better adaptability to acidic environments due to increased lactic acid production, \u03b2-glucan solubility, scavenging of free radicals, and an increase in total phenolic content by the bacterial strain [111]. An increase in vitamin B2 and B9 levels and elevated blood hemoglobin was detected when pasta fermentation was carried out with a mixed culture ofLactobacillus plantarumCRL 1964 andL. plantarumCRL 2107 [119]. Lactobacillus strains also display anti-colorectal cancer properties [119].Lactobacillus plantarum,Pediococcus pentosaceus, andLactobacillus rhamnosusare involved in the elimination of carcinogens and toxins from fecal material by modulating the mechanism and decreasing the pH [113].The usage ofStaphylococcus epidermidisfor application in basic cosmetics as a beneficial bacterium for skin health is widely accepted [136].S. epidermidisproduces several metabolic products, like organic acids and glycerin, which help maintain skin health by retaining moisture, improving the rough texture of the skin, and maintaining low acidic conditions on the surface of the skin [134]. Further, it also has anti-aging properties due to the presence of superoxide dismutase, which destroys reactive oxygen intermediates [136,137].Cutibacterium acnessecret propionic acid as one of the short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) during triacylglycerol fermentation in the sebum [127]. Propionic acid keeps the pH of hair follicles of sebaceous glands at an acidic level, thereby controlling the growth of pathogenic bacteria [138,139].5. Probiotic Bacteria and Their Benefits in Human HealthProbiotics are live, beneficial microorganisms, which include mostly bacteria and yeasts and are consumed or applied on the body and are proposed to improve or maintain our healthy lives [140]. The term symbiotics is used to define a combination of probiotics and prebiotics, the compounds used as a supplement with the probiotics that selectively favor the growth of beneficial bacteria and prevent the growth of harmful bacteria [140,141]. Probiotics play a critical role in the restoration of healthy gut microbiome communities that protect the gut by building a healthy intestinal mucous membrane, inhibiting the intestinal colonization of the pathogenic bacteria, ameliorating the host immunity, or preventing gut inflammation and systemic disease [109,141]. Apart from the promising role in the gut, the advantages of probiotics in human immune, reproductive, and respiratory systems, skin diseases, and oral and mental health have been demonstrated [142,143,144]. Lactic acid bacteria, a broad heterogeneous Gram-positive, spore-free bacteria, exist widely in the natural environment and include soil and fermented foods in or on the host body [105]. This group of bacteria plays a beneficial role in the host by regulating the microbiome in the gut [132]. Common strains of lactic acid bacteria, includingL. acidophilus,L. rhamnosus,L. casei,L. delbrueckii,L. plantarum,L. reuteri,L. pracasei,B. bifidum,B. animalis,B. longum,B. infantis,B. adolescentis, etc., are used as probiotics for health benefits.C. butyricum,S. boulardii,S. cerevisiae,B. coagulans, andE. coliNissle 1917 are widely used non-lactic acid bacteria and also have a probiotic effect on the hosts [42,116,132]. These microorganisms protect us from infections, hypertension, high blood cholesterol, diabetes, food allergies, oxidative stress, mutations, and carcinogens [145,146]. Here, we briefly summarize health-beneficial bacteria consumed by our body as probiotics for protection against several medical concerns.5.1. Reproductive HealthHistorically, it was thought that there were no native bacteria in the reproductive tract [147]. Many believed that microbes were only present during infection [148]. Several studies have demonstrated that the gut microbiome is an important regulatory component for sustaining the basal nourishing of the mammalian reproductive tract [130,132]. The healthy female reproductive tract has low bacterial diversity due to the main genusLactobacillusspp. [147]. Probiotics and the molecules they produce help maintain a healthy reproductive tract by supporting healthy bacterial communities, inhibiting pathogen growth, maintaining the proper pH, and facilitating the immune system to function properly [147,149]. In the female reproductive tract, probiotics not only help to maintain an acidic pH but also can aid in fertilization by promoting epithelial barrier function and membrane integrity, which are essential for successful basculation and formation of the amnion, chorion, and placenta [91,147,150]. One example of the symbiotic relationship between microbes and hosts in the female reproductive tract isLactobacillusspp., which metabolizes sugar glucose to produce energy and lactic acid [147]. This lactic acid then lowers the pH of the female reproductive tract and prevents pathogenic bacteria from growing, such asGardnerella vaginalis[147].5.2. Mental HealthAn altered microbiome in the gut\u2013brain axis has been associated with neuropsychological illnesses, including autism spectrum disorder and depression. Studies have also signified that the consumption of probiotics can modulate gut microbiomes that restore mental health. The beneficial effects of probiotics on the enteric nervous system and central nervous system have been reported by a series of investigations. For example, feedingL. reuterito rats for 9 days elevated excitability and declined the slow afterhyperpolarization in sensory afterhyperpolarization neurons [151]. Similarly, aB. longumNCC3001-fermented medium inhibits the enteric nervous system neuron excitability [152]. ProbioticL. rhamnosus, ingested into healthy Balb/C mice, reduced emotional behavior, including anxiety and depression [153]. A study demonstrated that healthy women volunteers consumed 4 weeks of a fermented milk product containingB. animalissubsp.Lactis,L. lactissubsp.Lactis,L. bulgaricus, andS. thermophilus, resulting in induced brain activity in the emotional system [154]. Healthy volunteers improved their mood after drinking milk containing probioticL. caseiShirota for 3 weeks [155]. One interesting study reported that 30 days of consumption of a formulated probiotic mixture consisting ofL. helveticusR0052 andB. longumR0175 by healthy volunteers improved their psychological distress. Furthermore, this study also demonstrated that the daily administration of the same mixture of probiotics to rats for 2 weeks showed anxiolytic-like activity [156]. Taken together, probiotics play a vital role in protecting mental health.5.3. Respiratory HealthMicrobes occupy virtually all the surfaces of the human body, and the respiratory tract is not an exception [157,158]. Recent techniques of respiratory biology have begun to shed light on the microbial world of the respiratory tract, which was long considered to be a sterile environment [33,130]. It is clear that the human lungs are often exposed to live microbes and their by-products, and the nature of the lung microbiome is distinct from other microbial communities residing in our bodies, such as the gut [132]. The upper and lower respiratory tracts have different microbial compositions and biomasses. The upper tract is made up of the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and pharynx, and the supraglottic portion of the larynx is primarily colonized with bacteria [157]. There are topographical differences in the microbial composition, and the nasal cavity and nasopharynx are dominated byMoraxella,Staphylococcus,Corynebacterium,Haemophilus, andStreptococcusspecies, while the oropharynx is dominated byPrevotella,Veillonella,Streptococcus,Leptotrichia,Rothia,Neisseria, andHaemophilusspecies [157]. On the contrary, the lower respiratory tract, which includes the trachea and lungs, exhibits low biomass due to rapid microbial clearance via several physiological mechanisms. It allows the lower tract to perform its most crucial function: the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide [33,42,130].6. Summary and ConclusionsIn this review, we highlighted the many ways by which microorganisms can influence their environment by altering the properties of their surroundings or by building microbial communities and structures. As environmental properties are also known to affect their surrounding microbial communities, the interaction between soil microbial community composition and soil microorganisms is reciprocal. Thus, microorganisms and their environmental interaction entail networks of causation of feedback, in which previously selected microorganisms drive environmental changes and, as a a consequence, microbially driven shifts in environmental properties subsequently shape microbial community composition and possibly evolutionary trajectories.To advance the field, integrative research bridging soil sciences, ecology, biogeochemistry, evolution, and microbiology is paramount. Owing to the interconnected nature of microbial communities and soil properties, identifying the underlying mechanisms remains challenging. With the pressing need to protect and restore the environment, future approaches and steps should leverage insights gained from studying natural systems. Progress towards understanding the functional roles of the microbiome in shaping soil properties can also come from using more proactive approaches, whereby microbial communities are directly manipulated in controlled experiments. Such studies should include examining the evolutionary consequences of niche construction by microorganisms. Thus, the evidence outlined in this review shows that microbially driven shifts in environmental properties can also have practical applications, such as limiting soil erosion, promoting carbon sequestration, or restoring contaminated soil through bioremediation. The directed modification of the microbiome is an emerging research area that requires a better understanding of how microbially mediated shifts in properties can be used to combat threats to health and other environmental challenges.Author ContributionsConceptualization writing and original draft preparation, methodology, review, editing and validation N.S.K., with the help of S.B., S.A.B., V.G. and D.C.

They adhere to surfaces, construct intricate \u201chouses\u201d, nurture within these habitats, and ultimately disperse [2]. These bacterial abodes, referred to as biofilm matrices, constitute a fascinating microcosm with far-reaching implications for various facets of human life [3]. The quality of these matrices can either be a boon or a bane\u2014a well-structured biofilm matrix holds the potential to establish biofilm reactors capable of efficiently removing heavy metal pollutants from water [4], while a compromised matrix can pave the way for infections and subsequent illnesses in the human body [5]. Therefore, the study of biofilm matrix stands at the nexus of environmental sustainability and public health [6].Biofilm matrices, as the architectural marvels of bacterial communities, represent a microcosm of self-sustaining life [7]. Similar to human societies, bacteria engage in communal living, constructing intricate matrix that serve as protective shelters and facilitators of growth [8]. The matrix, composed of a complex amalgamation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs) secreted by bacteria, create a microenvironment conducive to bacterial survival and proliferation [9].The significance of a biofilm matrix extends beyond the microbial realm, influencing various aspects of human life [9]. A well-formed biofilm matrix acts as a promising resource for environmental remediation. Specifically, it provides a platform for the development of biofilm reactors capable of efficiently removing heavy metal pollutants from water sources [4]. This eco-friendly approach not only addresses environmental challenges but also holds immense potential for sustainable water management.Conversely, when biofilm matrices deviate from their optimal state, they become potential sources of harm to human health [5]. Compromised, the matrices serve as breeding grounds for pathogenic bacteria, leading to infections and diseases in the human body. Understanding the delicate balance of biofilm matrix dynamics becomes crucial for developing strategies to mitigate the risks associated with bacterial infections.To unravel the multifaceted nature of biofilm matrices, this paper employs a bibliographic study methodology [10]. By analyzing a diverse selection of 1000 articles from reputable journals and databases, we aim to distill the core themes and advancements within the biofilm matrix research domain.

Simultaneously, we explore the contributions of various organizations, shedding light on the collaborative networks and influential entities driving advancements in this field.This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the current state of biofilm matrix research and identifies potential future directions through a bibliographic study. By analyzing keywords, geographic concentrations, and influential organizations, we aim to anticipate emerging trends and challenges. Our review of publications from the most influential universities and research institutes uncovers and interprets cutting-edge advancements in the biofilm matrix domain.2. Materials and MethodsIn November 2023, a comprehensive data collection was conducted using Web of Science, a reputable bibliographic database with various sub-databases [11]. The search focused on the term \u201cbiofilm matrix\u201d, and the author selected the top 1000 papers from this database to ensure reliability and broad applicability.For visualizing the bibliographic analysis, the powerful data visualization tool VOSviewer (Version: 1.6.17) was used [12,13]. The data files downloaded from Web of Science were imported into VOSviewer, which allowed for the adjustment of parameters according to the specific goals of the analysis and the diverse sources of data [14,15]. It is important to note that creating maps from web data often requires data cleaning to ensure accuracy and reliability. VOSviewer facilitated this data-cleaning process, helping to produce robust and meaningful visualizations.Unless stated otherwise, the mapping performed with VOSviewer followed the default settings as outlined in previous studies [10]. In the keyword analysis, a minimum occurrence of \u201c40\u201d for keywords was set. For the country analysis, at least \u201c10\u201d documents from each country were required for inclusion. Similarly, the organization analysis included only those organizations with a minimum of \u201c7\u201d documents.3.

Discussion4.1. Bacterial Architects: Crafting Biofilm Habitats for Life\u2019s ProcessesTo facilitate our understanding, we can compare the relationship between bacteria and the biofilm matrix to that of humans and their houses. Bacteria, akin to ingenious architects, function as master builders, intricately crafting their \u201chouses\u201d in the form of a biofilm matrix (Table 1). This matrix provides a multifaceted environment for their initial attachment, maturation, and eventual dispersion [16]. Within the complex architecture of the biofilm matrix, numerous integral components converge, including proteins, polysaccharides, extracellular DNA, lipids, and other elements essential to the structural integrity and functionality of this microbial habitat [17] (Figure 4).Proteins take center stage as the foundational bricks within the intricate construction of the biofilm matrix [18,19,20]. Their prominence lies not only in sheer abundance but also in their pivotal role, constituting a substantial and indispensable aspect of the entire biofilm structure. Much like the bricks that form the essential groundwork for a physical house, these proteins contribute significantly to the biofilm\u2019s structural framework, providing the necessary support and foundation for the intricate three-dimensional matrix that defines microbial habitats. Their multifaceted functions extend beyond mere abundance, acting as key players in orchestrating the stability and coherence of the biofilm, akin to the foundational bricks that uphold the structural integrity of a well-built edifice.Polysaccharides assume a function comparable to reinforcing steel in the intricate architecture of the biofilm matrix [21,22,23]. Acting as a structural backbone, polysaccharides contribute crucial support and stability to the overall framework, mirroring the way reinforcing steel fortifies the structural integrity of buildings. Their involvement goes beyond mere composition; these polysaccharides play an instrumental role in fortifying the biofilm matrix, ensuring its resilience and longevity as a microbial dwelling. This reinforcement mechanism not only bolsters the structural integrity of the biofilm but also enhances its ability to withstand external pressures, environmental fluctuations, and other challenges, creating a robust and enduring habitat for microbial life processes.Extracellular DNA, another vital component, can be metaphorically compared to cement [24,25]. This genetic material acts as the binding agent, intricately connecting the protein \u201cbricks\u201d and polysaccharide \u201csteel\u201d, solidifying the entire matrix. The intricate interplay of these components highlights the cohesive nature of the biofilm, sustained by the presence of extracellular DNA.Lipids, functioning as additives in this microbial construction, play a dual role as lubricants and fixatives [26]. They facilitate the smooth transport of various components within the matrix while simultaneously securing them in designated areas. This lipid-driven process ensures the optimal arrangement and functionality of the diverse elements within the biofilm matrix.In essence, the organic amalgamation of proteins, polysaccharides, extracellular DNA, lipids, and other elements transforms bacteria into skilled architects, enabling them to construct resilient and efficient \u201chouses\u201d in the form of biofilm matrices, each uniquely tailored to their specific ecological needs and challenges.Table 1.Components of biofilm matrix and their functions.Table 1.Components of biofilm matrix and their functions.ComponentsKey FindingsReferenceProteinMicroorganisms primarily exist as biofilms, surface-attached microbial communities with diverse compositions, where proteinaceous elements, including adhesins and flagella subunits, are crucial.[18]ProteinProtein involvement varies in different stages ofStaphylococcibiofilm formation.[19]ProteinThis study exploresStaphylococcus aureusbiofilm dynamics on clinically relevant materials, revealing surface-dependent variations in formation efficiency and the evolving roles of poly-N-acetyl-\u03b2-(1-6)-glucosamine (PNAG) and proteins in early and later stages, respectively.[20]PolysaccharideThe study unveils the crucial role of the Psl exopolysaccharide in biofilm formation by mucoidPseudomonas aeruginosa, indicating that Psl is a vital matrix component for both nonmucoid and mucoid biofilms, with potential implications for designing therapies forPseudomonas aeruginosainfections in cystic fibrosis patients.[21]PolysaccharidePel, one of the extracellular polysaccharides produced byPseudomonas aeruginosa, serves a dual function in biofilms by acting as a crucial structural scaffold for cell-to-cell interactions and enhancing resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics, with its impact being strain-specific in biofilm development.[22]PolysaccharideExtracellular polysaccharides, including alginate, Pel, and Psl inPseudomonas aeruginosa, contribute to biofilm matrix formation, with strain-specific variations in Pel and Psl functions, suggesting redundancy as a mechanism for biofilm stability and adaptability.[23]Extracellular DNAThe research developed a novel approach with mass spectrometry, identifying previously unrecognized DNA-binding lipoproteins inStaphylococcus aureusbiofilms that enhance biofilm formation, contribute to structure, and are linked to nuclease production, extending the electrostatic net model to include these proteins as anchor points between extracellular DNA and the bacterial cell surface.[24]Extracellular DNAExtracellular DNA in biofilms, initially overlooked but now recognized for its pivotal role, influences bacterial adhesion, biofilm structure, and antimicrobial resistance through active secretion or controlled cell lysis, acid\u2013base interactions, the chelation of cations, and triggering genetic responses, highlighting its potential as a target for biofilm sensitization and novel antimicrobial strategies.[25]LipidThis paper highlights that while rhamnolipids have been previously considered crucial for hydrocarbon uptake in bacterial cells, recent evidence indicates their primary role in surface-associated motility and biofilm development, providing insights into their environmental impact in microbial ecosystems.[26]4.2. Exploring the Biofilm Matrix LandscapeOver the past few years, there has been a notable surge in research papers dedicated to exploring the diverse facets of the biofilm matrix. This upswing can be attributed to the increasing awareness among scientists about the profound impact of the biofilm matrix on various aspects of human daily life.Table 2thoughtfully compiles a range of key research papers published during this period, providing insights into the significant growth in this field.Upon a closer examination ofTable 2, the varied spectrum of microorganisms utilized by researchers to investigate the intricacies of the biofilm matrix becomes apparent. These microorganisms encompassEscherichia coli,Shewanella oneidensis,Comamonas testosterone,Bacillus halodurans, andPseudomonas aeruginosa, highlighting the diversity of species harnessed in the pursuit of knowledge about the biofilm matrix. Moreover, the research areas within biofilm matrix studies exhibit the same diversity as the microorganisms themselves.In the field of engineering, the biofilm matrix has emerged as a powerful tool for addressing environmental challenges. Many developing countries face water pollution due to heavy metals. The biofilm matrix can play a crucial role in removing pollutants and purifying water sources [27,28]. Concurrently, it has found applications in the development of microbial fuel cells that generate energy, opening new avenues for sustainable power generation [29]. Additionally, the biofilm matrix has played a transformative role in civil engineering, contributing to the advancement of self-healing concrete, which holds the potential to revolutionize infrastructure durability [30].In the medical sphere, the biofilm matrix poses a unique challenge in the context of lung infections [31,32,33]. Techniques for preventing and treating such infections have become a focal point of intense research efforts, given their critical importance to public health and well-being. Simultaneously, the field of chemical characterization has witnessed significant endeavors aimed at unraveling the chemical mapping and obtaining higher-resolution fluorescence images of the biofilm matrix [34]. The study highlighted that various environmental factors, including temperature, pH, salt, glucose concentration, and oxygen levels, significantly influence the biofilm formation ofStaphylococcus[35]. These endeavors have deepened our understanding of the intricate composition of biofilm matrices and their potential applications.In summary, the growing interest in the biofilm matrix and its multifaceted roles underscore the pivotal position this field occupies in contemporary research, offering innovative solutions to some of the most pressing challenges in environmental engineering, healthcare, and materials science.Table 2.Prominent research in the biofilm matrix field over the past 15 years.Table 2.Prominent research in the biofilm matrix field over the past 15 years.CategoryModel SpeciesMain FindingsReferenceEngineeringShewanellasp.

This envisioned database emerges as a colossal and comprehensive resource, representing a veritable treasure trove for scientists embarking on the profound exploration of biofilm matrix intricacies. With such an extensive dataset at their fingertips, scientists are primed to leverage the formidable power of machine learning models, unlocking deeper insights into the multifaceted dimensions of biofilm matrix dynamics [46].The implications of this convergence between advanced technologies and biofilm matrix research are monumental. The envisioned insights, drawn from the extensive dataset, have the potential to transcend the boundaries of biofilm studies, permeating various realms of scientific inquiry. In the realm of medical sciences, these revelations could become instrumental in shaping informed medical decision making, revolutionizing drug design methodologies, and fortifying infection control strategies. As we peer into this technological crystal ball, we witness the emergence of a new epoch\u2014an era where knowledge-driven approaches take center stage in the relentless pursuit of combatting biofilm-related health threats.This collaborative synergy between cutting-edge technologies and the intricate realm of biofilm matrices opens a gateway to innovation and transformative possibilities. It not only underscores the remarkable potential of amalgamating advanced technologies with biofilm matrix research but also signifies a paradigm shift toward more informed, efficacious, and personalized strategies in our ongoing battle against the myriad health challenges posed by biofilm-related issues. The envisioned future, painted with the strokes of technological prowess and scientific exploration, beckons us toward a horizon where our understanding of biofilm matrix intricacies propels us into a new era of groundbreaking solutions and improved healthcare outcomes.5.

This review focuses on how biofertilizers could optimize plant\u2013microbe interactions, promoting nutrient uptake, pest control, and soil health. Key biofertilizers, including nitrogen-fixing, phosphate-solubilizing, and potassium-solubilizing bacteria, improve nutrient availability, which leads to higher crop yields and resilience. They also enhance soil water retention and drought tolerance, which are crucial under changing climate conditions. Biofertilizers support beneficial microbial communities, reducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides while fostering disease suppression and stress tolerance in crops. Their effectiveness can be significantly increased when biofertilizers are integrated with push\u2013pull technology (PPT). However, challenges remain, such as inconsistent biofertilizer performance and the complexity of microbial interactions. Overcoming these challenges necessitates a multidisciplinary approach to refining production and application techniques. This study emphasizes the need to investigate biofertilizer-mediated plant\u2013microbiome dynamics further to unlock their full potential. It concludes that future research should focus on the synergies between biofertilizers and agroecological systems to enhance food security and environmental sustainability.

        "content": "1. IntroductionThe rising need for producing food and the negative effects on the environment caused by farming methods have sparked a focus on sustainable agriculture practices. Recently, the application of biofertilizers in crop production has gained prominence as a sustainable approach to enhancing soil health and crop productivity [1,2]. Among various agroecological practices, push\u2013pull cropping systems have emerged as a highly effective method for managing pests, improving soil fertility, and boosting crop yields [3,4,5,6]. Push\u2013pull technology (PPT) involves the strategic use of trap and repellent crops to manage pest populations while enhancing soil health through the incorporation of beneficial microorganisms [7]. Despite its proven benefits, the effectiveness of push\u2013pull systems can be significantly enhanced by the application of biofertilizers, which support and amplify beneficial microbiomes in the plant\u2013soil continuum [8,9]. However, to fully realize the potential of biofertilizers in PPT, it is essential to understand the mechanisms underlying their interactions with crops and associated microbial communities [10].Push\u2013pull technologies have demonstrated their ability to improve crop productivity and manage pest infestations in various farming contexts [7]. These systems leverage plant\u2013microbe interactions to create more resilient agricultural environments. Biofertilizers, including phosphate-solubilizing bacteria (PSB) [11], potassium-solubilizing bacteria (KSB) [12], and nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB) [13], play a crucial role in optimizing these interactions by enhancing nutrient availability and supporting microbial communities. Research has shown that biofertilizers significantly improve soil properties and plant health by fostering beneficial microbiomes that contribute to nutrient cycling, disease suppression, and stress tolerance [14,15,16,17,18]. The ability of biofertilizers to stimulate plant growth and defense responses further amplifies the benefits of PPT, leading to improved crop yields and reduced reliance on synthetic inputs [10]. However, successfully integrating biofertilizers into PPT hinges on understanding the intricate relationships between the crop, the associated microbial community, and surrounding environmental factors.Recognizing these complexities, researchers have made extensive efforts to elucidate the mechanisms by which biofertilizers enhance the performance of PPT. Key mechanisms include the direct promotion of plant growth through phytohormone production, enhanced nutrient availability via biological nitrogen fixation and phosphate solubilization, and the suppression of plant pathogens through antimicrobial compound production and the induction of systemic resistance [10,18]. For instance, PSB increase phosphorus availability, a critical nutrient for plant growth [11,19,20,21], while KSB improve potassium availability, vital for crop resilience [12,22]. Similarly, NFB contribute to soil nitrogen content, promoting plant growth and yield [23]. Integrating these biofertilizers within PPT can enhance their effectiveness and support sustainable agricultural practices by reducing reliance on chemical fertilizers and improving soil health. Therefore, the strategic use of biofertilizers in PPT holds great promise for advancing sustainable and resilient agricultural systems [10,24,25,26]. However, a deeper understanding of biofertilizer-mediated changes in plant\u2013microbiome interactions is needed to maximize their potential within PPT systems [10,18,25,27].Furthermore, biofertilizers can improve soil water retention and plant drought tolerance\u2014critical factors in changing climate conditions [8,28]. Recent studies have shown that applying biochar and microbial inoculants can enhance water retention and crop productivity, which can benefit push\u2013pull systems [29,30]. Despite the growing body of evidence supporting biofertilizers in PPT, further research is needed to fully understand how these microorganisms interact with plant and soil systems [31]. The potential for biofertilizer adoption in PPT is hindered by several challenges, including variable and unpredictable performance, the complex interactions between biofertilizers and the soil\u2013plant\u2013microbe continuum, and the lack of robust and reliable production and application methods [10,26]. Overcoming these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach, bringing together microbiologists, plant scientists, and agronomists to develop innovative solutions. This study aims to explore the application of biofertilizers in enhancing beneficial microbiomes within PPT, focusing on their impact on pest management, soil health, water management, and crop productivity. The research will contribute to optimizing PPT and advancing sustainable agricultural practices by bridging gaps in current knowledge.2. Push\u2013Pull TechnologyPush\u2013pull technology (PPT) is an agroecological strategy that involves the intercropping of companion crops to manage pests without heavy reliance on chemical pesticides [3,5,6,32]. This approach combines \u201cpush\u201d crops that repel pests and \u201cpull\u201d crops that attract pests away from the main crop. The most popular PPT practiced in East Africa involves maize or sorghum intercropped with leguminous plants of the genusDesmodium(Fabaceae), surrounded byNapier grass(Pennisetum purpureum) orBrachiariaspecies (both Poaceae) [33]. TheDesmodiumintercrop protects cereal crops by repelling stem borer pests, including the emergingSpodoptera frugiperda(fall armyworm), through a \u201cpush\u201d effect while attracting parasitoids such asCotesia ruficrus,Cotesia sesamiae, andTrichogrammaspp. These parasitoids further reduce pest populations by parasitizing the pests, laying their eggs on or inside them, with the larvae consuming the host from within [34,35]. Additionally, microbial parasites are crucial in pest management within push\u2013pull systems. For example,Bacillus thuringiensis(Bt) produces toxins that are lethal to specific insect larvae [3], while entomopathogenic fungi, such asBeauveria bassianaandMetarhizium anisopliae,infect and kill insects by penetrating their cuticles and growing inside them [36]. Furthermore,Pythiumspp., a group of oomycetes, can parasitize insect larvae by infecting their tissues. The peripheral grasses act as a \u201cpull\u201d factor, attracting pests away from the crops for oviposition but preventing full larval development, thereby functioning as ecological traps.In addition to pest control, PPT provides other agroecosystem benefits, such as reducing the need for synthetic chemical pesticides and fertilizers\u2014an essential step toward sustainable agriculture. The allelopathic effects ofDesmodiumroot exudates help control parasitic weeds, such asStriga hermonthica[7].Desmodiumis a leguminous species that also improves soil health by fixing nitrogen, facilitating carbon sequestration, solubilizing phosphorus, and depositing organic matter [37]. Plant-associated microbiomes further enhance productivity and overall plant health by regulating nutrient availability and uptake, improving tolerance to abiotic stress and increasing disease resistance. The root-mediated mechanisms that promote microbial species diversity in the soil within PPT systems can be further amplified by applying biofertilizers.3. Beneficial Microbes in the Plant\u2013Soil ContinuumPlant\u2013soil microbiomes are crucial for plant health, stress tolerance, nutrient acquisition, and interactions with agricultural practices (Table 1). Research by [38] has demonstrated that plant-associated microbes enhance plant growth, disease resistance, and overall health by interacting with roots and influencing nutrient uptake. However, the specific mechanisms through which these interactions occur, particularly under varying environmental conditions, remain insufficiently understood. The role of the rhizosphere microbiome in suppressing soil-borne pathogens and enhancing disease resistance through various mechanisms has been well established [39,40,41,42,43]. Ref. [40] emphasize that the rhizosphere microbiome plays a critical role in plant health by influencing root growth, nutrient uptake, and disease resistance. Another study highlights the complexity of interactions within the rhizosphere, where beneficial microorganisms suppress plant pathogens through various mechanisms, including producing secondary metabolites, competition for nutrients and space, and modulation of the plant immune system [42]. Ref. [43] show that specific strains of fluorescentPseudomonascan induce systemic resistance in plants, providing enhanced defense against a wide range of pathogens. Their study explains that the bacteria trigger plant immune responses without directly killing pathogens, leading to more robust and sustained disease resistance. Ref. [40] highlight that those beneficial microbes in the rhizosphere, such as mycorrhizal fungi and nitrogen-fixing bacteria, can help plants tolerate abiotic stresses, like drought and heat, which may also indirectly improve their resistance to pathogens. Nevertheless, more detailed studies are needed to understand how plant species and soil types influence these microbial communities.Endophytic microorganisms have improved plant tolerance to environmental stresses such as drought, salinity, and metal toxicity [44,45,46]. For example,Piriformospora indicahas been demonstrated to enhance drought tolerance in crops, like wheat and barley, by promoting root growth, increasing water and nutrient uptake, and boosting the expression of stress-responsive genes [45].Bacillus subtilishas been found to improve drought tolerance in maize by stimulating the production of plant growth hormones, such as auxins, which increase root biomass and water retention [46]. Similarly,Pseudomonas fluorescensandAzospirillum brasilensehave been reported to enhance salinity tolerance in rice and wheat by improving ion homeostasis, reducing oxidative stress, and facilitating nutrient uptake [44].Enterobacter cloacaehas been found to increase plant salt tolerance by producing phytohormones and enhancing antioxidant enzyme activities, which help plants cope with the osmotic stress induced by high salt levels [47].Pseudomonas putidahas also been reported to reduce heavy metal toxicity (such as cadmium and lead) in plants by sequestering metals in root tissues and promoting the production of stress-related proteins [48]. Despite these findings, the precise pathways through which endophytes alleviate these stresses, as well as their potential applications in sustainable agriculture, require further exploration.Symbiotic relationships between plants and microbes, such as mycorrhizae and NFB, significantly enhance nutrient uptake [49]. Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) have been shown to improve the uptake of phosphorus (P), which is typically immobile in soil.Glomus intraradicesextend the root system by forming hyphal networks that explore the soil more efficiently than plant roots alone, thereby enhancing P uptake in wheat by facilitating nutrient transport [50].Pisolithus tinctorius, an ectomycorrhizal fungus commonly associated with trees, such as pine, oak, and birch, enhances nitrogen (N) and P uptake, promoting tree growth in nutrient-poor soils [51].Rhizobium leguminosarumforms nodules on pea roots, providing the plant with fixed N in exchange for carbon compounds from the plant [52].Azospirillumis associated with the roots of grasses (maize, wheat, rice, etc.), enhancing N availability and stimulating root growth by producing plant growth hormones such as auxins, gibberellins, and cytokinins [53].Herbaspirillum seropedicaeis an endophytic nitrogen fixer associated with sugarcane productivity in low-N soils [54]. However, the genetic and environmental factors that optimize these symbioses for different crops are not yet fully understood.Agricultural practices such as crop rotation, tillage, and fertilization can significantly alter plant-associated microbiomes [55,56,57]. Crop rotation, the practice of alternating different crops (e.g., soybean and maize) in the same field, promotes a more diverse soil microbiome. During the legume phase, the populations ofRhizobiumandBradyrhizobiumincrease, enhancing N availability and microbial diversity [55]. Additionally, crop rotation can reduce soil pathogen populations, as non-host crops interrupt the life cycles of pathogens specific to certain crops. For instance, rotating cereal crops with brassicas (e.g., mustard) have been shown to reduce populations of soil-borne pathogens, likeRhizoctoniaandFusariumspp., thereby allowing beneficial microbes to thrive [58]. Conversely, conventional tillage can disrupt microbial communities and reduce the abundance of fungi, such as AMF. In contrast, no-tillage practices promote the growth of beneficial microbes, likePseudomonasandBacillusspp., which support crop growth and enhance disease resistance [59]. The impact of fertilization on the soil microbiome depends on the fertilizer used. Synthetic nitrogen fertilizers alter microbial community composition by favoring fast-growing bacteria that thrive in nitrogen-rich environments while reducing the abundance of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and mycorrhizal fungi [60]. Organic fertilizers, by contrast, enhance soil microbial diversity by providing a slow-release nutrient source and increasing organic matter content. Studies have shown that applying compost to fields increases populations of beneficial microbes, such asTrichodermaspp., which can suppress soil-borne pathogens, and promote the growth of phosphate-solubilizing bacteria that improve phosphorus availability to plants [61]. However, there remains a gap in understanding how specific agricultural practices can be optimized to maintain or enhance beneficial microbial communities.Table 1.Studies on beneficial microbes in the plant\u2013soil continuum.Table 1.Studies on beneficial microbes in the plant\u2013soil continuum.Microbes StudiedKey Benefits"

        "abstract": "Background: Several Acinetobacter species live in different ecosystems, such as soil, freshwater, wastewater, and solid wastes, which has attracted considerable research interests in public health and agriculture. Methods: We assessed the distribution of Acinetobacter baumannii and Acinetobacter nosocomialis in three freshwater resources (Great Fish, Keiskemma, and Tyhume rivers) in South Africa between April 2017\u2013March 2018. Molecular identification of Acinetobacter species was performed using Acinetobacter-specific primers targeting the recA gene, whilst confirmed species were further delineated into A. baumannii and A. nosocomialis. Similarly, virulence genes; afa/draBC, epsA, fimH, OmpA, PAI, sfa/focDE, and traT in the two Acinetobacter species were assessed. Results: Our finding revealed that 410 (48.58%) and 23 (2.7%) of the isolates were confirmed as A. baumannii and A. nosocomalis, respectively. Additionally, three hundred and eight (75.12%) A. baumannii and three (13.04%) A. nosocomialis exhibited one or more of the virulence genes among the seven tested. OmpA was the most prevalent virulence gene in A. baumannii in freshwater sources. Conclusions: The distribution of clinically important Acinetobacter species in the freshwater sources studied suggests possible contamination such as the release of hospital wastewater and other clinical wastes into the environment thereby posing a risk to public health.",

        "content": "1. IntroductionManyAcinetobacterspecies are free-living and ubiquitous in nature, but the clinically important species, especially theAcinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii(ACB) complex, are frequently isolated from hospital environments. Among members of this complex,A. baumannii,A. nosocomialis, andA. pittiiare well-reported causative agents ofAcinetobacter-related infections in hospitals around the globe [1,2]. However,A. baumanniiis known to cause more infections, especially among the immunosuppressed individuals and those in intensive care units (ICUs) [1]. Owing to the importance of this disease-causing species in clinical settings, some scientists have reported that it is a nosocomial pathogen and its occurrence in other environments is rare [2]. However, in recent discoveries, some strains ofA. baumanniihave been reported to thrive in freshwater, soil, and healthy human skin just like other non-pathogenic species in the genus [3,4]. The occurrence ofA. baumanniiand other pathogenic species of the genusAcinetobacterin other environmental niches, apart from healthcare institutions, could be associated with the indiscriminate disposal of wastewater and materials from the hospital into the environment [5].The isolation ofA. baumanniifrom hospitalized patients is often associated with severe infections that are disseminated through exposure to contaminated hospital materials such as ventilators, wastewater, beds, and surrounding curtains, along with bedrails, bedside tables, water used for nasogastric feeding or ventilator rinsing, and gas taps behind the beds, in addition to door handles and sinks [6]. Additionally,A. baumanniihas been implicated in a range of disease presentations, such asAcinetobacterpneumonia-bronchiolitis and tracheobronchitis [7,8], bloodstream infection [2], wound infection, urinary tract infection [9], and meningitis [7,10]. Similarly,A. nosocomialiswas responsible for bacteraemia [11,12], pneumonia [13], and the induction of epithelial cell death and host inflammatory responses [14].The pathogenicity ofAcinetobacterspecies like other microorganisms is strongly associated with the virulence factors they harbour, such as porins (OmpA), capsular polysaccharides, lipopolysaccharides (LPS), phospholipase, outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), protein secretion systems, and the metal acquisition system [6,7]. OmpA is a protein located on the outer cell membrane of the bacteria, which is responsible for the selective permeation of materials in and out of the cell. OmpA also binds to the host epithelial cell in order to gain entry into the cell cytoplasmic environment. As such, it may be relevant in leading to programmed cell death (apoptosis) by releasing cytochrome c. OmpA was also noted as one of the factors with whichA. nosocomialisinitiates its pathogenesis [15]. Pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria are known to secret OMVs [16,17] for interaction between the bacterial pathogens and the host cells [18]. Kim et al. [15] showed thatA. nosocomialisuses its OMVs for the secretion of cytotoxic factors with which it elicits an immune response from the host epithelial cell. Phospholipase also contributes to the virulence of the pathogenicAcinetobacterspecies by hydrolysing phospholipid bilayer of the host cell membrane to destabilize the entire cell [19].Thus, an investigation of the occurrence and distribution of these clinically importantAcinetobacterspecies in other environments, other than the hospital, is very necessary for the understanding of their nature and diversity [20]. Therefore, the focus of this study was to assess the occurrence, distribution, and the virulence factors of clinically importantAcinetobacterspecies such asA. baumanniiandA. nosocomialisin the selected freshwater sources in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, to redefine the environmental coverage of these pathogens beyond clinical settings2. Materials and Methods2.1. Description of Study AreasCollection of water samples was carried out from three rivers, namely, Great Fish, Keiskamma and Tyhume, in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, between April 2017 and March 2018. The Great Fish River is in the Chris Hani District Municipality in the Eastern Cape Province, and it is one of the major rivers used for irrigation and livestock farming in the area. This river is prone to agricultural and municipal runoffs and serves as the receiving stream of effluents from many wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), especially those situated in urban communities such as Craddock. The Keiskamma and Tyhume rivers are in the Amathole District Municipality in the Eastern Cape Province and are exposed to different anthropogenic activities from the rural and urban communities along the river courses, such as livestock drinking and irrigation farming. In addition, these rivers receive effluents from wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) situated close to their banks. Different sampling points on these rivers were selected based on where humans and animals come into direct contact with them, for example, points used for fishing, drinking, and swimming purposes, downstream of the WWTPs, points where irrigation water is released to the water bodies, and proximity to hospital facilities.2.2. SamplingWater samples were collected from the Great Fish, Keiskamma and Tyhume rivers respectively, for a period of one year, which covers the four seasonal patterns in South Africa (autumn, winter, spring, and summer). Water samples were collected aseptically in sterile 1 L glass bottles from different sampling points by midstream-dipping of sample bottles at 25\u201330 cm down the water column, with the mouth tilting against the flow of the river. All water samples were labelled properly and safely taken to the laboratory (in an ice chest) where they were processed within 6 h of collection [21]. Aliquots of water samples were used for the isolation of Acinetobacter species based on standard microbiological procedures [22].2.3. Isolation and Purification of Presumptive Acinetobacter SpeciesThe isolation of the presumptive density ofAcinetobacterspecies in the water samples was determined by the membrane filtration technique [23]. Cellulose membranes of pore size 0.45 \u03bcm were used to filter three volumes of 100 mL of the water samples under vacuum [23]. These membranes were aseptically placed on plates withAcinetobacterspecies selective medium-CHROMagarAcinetobacterbase plus supplement AC092 (CHROMagar, Paris, France), which was prepared according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Each sample plate was subjected to incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 24 h after inoculation. Each sample was analysed in triplicate. All bacterial colonies with red colouration on the CHROMagar plates were counted as presumptiveAcinetobacterspecies and were expressed as CFU/100 mL. All isolates were sub-cultured on nutrient agar using a streak plate method (Oxoid, Hampshire, UK) and purified for further species identification. Fifty percent (50%) glycerol stocks of the pure culture was prepared and stored at \u221280 \u00b0C.2.4. Molecular Identification of Acinetobacter Species by PCR AssaysExtraction of genomic DNA: PresumptiveAcinetobacterspp. in glycerol stocks was resuscitated on tryptic soy broth and incubated for 18 to 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. DNA extraction from the bacterial isolates was carried out using the direct boiling method according to [24]. The broth culture was centrifuged at 15,000 rpm for 5 min using a Mini Spin Microcentrifuge (Lasec, RSA, Cape Town, South Africa), then the supernatant was dispensed out and the pellet rinsed with sterile normal saline. The pellet was re-suspended in sterile distilled water and boiled in a heating block for 10 min using an AccuBlock (Digital dry bath, Labnet, Edison, NJ, USA).2.5. Amplification of Unique Acinetobacter Species DNAThe polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used for the amplification of theAcinetobacterspeciesrecAgene as previously described [25]. The forward and reverse primers used were P-rA1 (5\u2032-CCTGAATCTTCTGGTAAAAC-3\u2032) and P-rA2 (5\u2032-GTTTCTGGGCTGCCAAACATTAC-3\u2032), respectively. Briefly, an aliquot of 25 \u03bcL containing Taq PCR (12.5 \u03bcL) Master Mix (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), each of the primers (1 \u03bcL) (Inqaba, SA), nuclease-free water (6.5 \u03bcL), and DNA template (5 \u03bcL) was used for the PCR amplification assay. The condition for the amplification included the initial denaturation step (94 \u00b0C, 5 min), followed by 35 cycles (92 \u00b0C, 40 s), annealing (58 \u00b0C, 40 s), and the final extension step (72 \u00b0C, 10 min) was performed using a thermocycler (Bio-Rad Thermal cycler, Hercules, CA, USA). Five microlitres (5 \u03bcL) of the amplicon was subjected to gel (1.5% agarose) electrophoresis at 100 volts for 45 min in Tris Boric EDTA buffer (pH 8.0) (0.089 M Tris, 0.089 M boric acid, and 0.002 M EDTA). Ethidium bromide (5 \u03bcL of 0.5 mg/mL) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was used for gel staining, and DNA ladder (100 bp) (Thermo Scientific, Vilnius, (EU) Lithuania) was added into the gels as a standard. Finally, the DNA bands were visualized under an Alliance 4.7 ultraviolet transilluminator (Alliance XD-79.WL/26MX, Paris, France).2.6. Delineation of Genus Acinetobacter into SpeciesThe confirmed Acinetobacter isolates were delineated into species accordingly [25,26,27] using a PCR assay. Firstly, the optimization of conditions forA. baumannii,A. nosocomialis, andA. pittiiwas carried out using species-specific primers (Table 1), while reference strains DSM 102929, DSM-102856, and DSM-9341 (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) were used as positive controls forA. baumannii,A. nosocomialis, andA. pittii, respectively. The PCR amplification was performed as stated in the previous section.2.7. Detection of Virulence GenesPolymerase chain reactions were also carried out for the identification of some Acinetobacter virulence genes, including theafa/draBC,epsA,fimH,OmpA,PAI,sfa/focDE, andtraTgenes, which have been previously found in clinical samples [28,29,30] (Table 2). The standard strain ofA. baumanniiDSM-30007 (DSMZ, Germany) was used as a positive control. There was no positive control available forA. nosocomialis. The PCR assay and electrophoresis were conducted as described earlier.2.8. Statistical AnalysisAll statistical analyses were performed using the Statistica software v13.4.0.14 (64-bits). A simple factorial ANOVA was performed for the comparison of normally distributed data.p-Values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant for all the statistical tests performed.3. Results3.1. Isolation of Presumptive Acinetobacter SpeciesA total of 1107 presumptiveAcinetobacterspp. was recovered from the three rivers studied, of which 370, 309, and 428 isolates belonged to Great Fish, Keiskamma, and Tyhume respectively. The results of the isolates are summarized and presented inTable 3.3.2. PCR Amplification for Confirmation of Genus AcinetobacterTo further validate the distribution of the bacteria in the genusAcinetobacterin this study, the identification was achieved by using the PCR-based assay to detect internalrecAgenes that are specific to allAcinetobacterspecies (Figure 1). The result inFigure S1represents the PCR product of the gel electrophoresis and staining for the amplification of the 425 bp fragment, which corresponds to therecAgene. Out of the 107 presumptive isolates, 844 was identified and confirmed to belong to the genusAcinetobacter, of which 285 (77%), 219 (70.9%), and 340 (79%) were found in the Great Fish, Keiskamma, and Tyhume rivers respectively (Table 3).3.3. Delineation of the Acinetobacter spp. into SpeciesThe speciation of the genusAcinetobacterwas also performed using PCR assay to amplify theA. baumanniispecific primer,Ab-ITSgene, andA. nosocomailisspecific primer,gyrBgene, at 208 bp and 294 bp fragments corresponding to the genes, respectively. The result inFigures S2 and S3shows the PCR product of the gel electrophoresis and staining for the delineation of the genusAcinetobacterintoA. baumanniiandA. nosocomailisaccordingly. From the results, 411 (48.7%) and 23 (2.7%) of the isolates were delineated to beA. baumanniiandA. nosocomailis, which were recovered from the Great Fish (154 (54%), 16 (5.6%), Keiskamma (102 (46.6%), and 3 (1.4%), and Tyhume 155 (48.7%), and 4 (1.2%)) rivers, respectively. The results of the delineation intoA. baumanniiandA. nosocomailisare summarized and presented inTable 3.3.4. Detection of Virulence GenesThe gel electrophoresis of the virulence genesafa/draBC,epsA,fimH,OmpA,PAI,sfa/focDE, andtraTare presented inFigure S4. The virulence genes haboured byA. baumanniiandA. nosocomialisin this study are presented inFigure 2and summarized inTable 4. Additionally, the virulence gene(s) associated with each of theAcinetobacterspecies, as well as the river source from which they were isolated, is described.Three hundred and eight (75%) of the 410A. baumanniiand three (13%) of the 23A. nosocomialisisolated from the rivers exhibited one or more virulence genes out of the seven tested. Respectively, 102 (24.88%) and 20 (86.95%) of theA. baumanniiandA. nosocomialisisolates from the three rivers did not harbour any of the virulence genes tested in this study. However, there was a significant difference (p< 0.05) in the prevalence of virulence genes harboured byA. baumanniicompared toA. nosocomialis, though the population of the former was significantly higher than the latter in all cases.As shown inTable 4, the prevalence of the virulence geneafa/draBCwas significantly higher in the isolates from the Great Fish river in comparison to the Keiskamma and Tyhume rivers. However, there was a significant difference in prevalence between the afa/draBC genes haboured by the bacteria recovered from the Tyhume river when compared to those from the Keiskamma river. Likewise, the prevalence of thetraTgene in the Acinetobacter species from the Great Fish and Tyhume rivers showed no statistical difference, but both were significantly higher than those detected in isolates from the Keiskamma river. Similarly, the prevalence of thefimHgene detected in isolates recovered from the Great Fish river was significantly higher than those detected in isolates from both the Keiskamma and Tyhume rivers. Nonetheless, the proportion of isolates harbouring the gene in Keiskamma was significantly lower than those from Tyhume river. The prevalence of thePAIvirulence gene was not significantly different in all the rivers studied. In Great Fish and Keiskamma rivers, there was no significant difference in the prevalence ofsfa/focDEin isolates recovered from the rivers, but the proportion ofAcinetobacterspecies in Tyhume harbouring the gene was significantly higher than in those from both the Great Fish and Keiskamma rivers. The number ofAcinetobacterspecies harbouring theepsAvirulence gene in the Great Fish river was significantly higher than those recovered from the Keiskamma river but significantly lower than inAcinetobacterspecies recovered from the Tyhume river. The prevalence of the OmpA virulence gene was significantly higher inA. baumanniiisolates than in all other virulence genes in this study. Withal,OmpAwas the most prevalent virulence gene in the rivers, which represented 69 (45.10%), 52 (50.98%), and 77 (49.68%) A. baumannii isolates in the Great Fish, Keiskamma, and Tyhume rivers, respectively. The number ofAcienotobacterspecies harbouringOmpAgene in the Great Fish river was significantly higher than isolates from the Keiskamma river, whereas the Tyhume river maintained the highest level of statistical significance (p< 0.05) of the totalAcinetobacterspecies exhibiting the virulence gene.4. DiscussionBacteria in the genusAcinetobacterhave been known to colonize a wide range of ecological systems, including water, soil, sludge, wastewater, plants\u2019 root, and animals, using virulence factors as well as the formation of biofilms to adapt and survive in harsh environments [31]. This current study has revealed the distribution and virulence traits ofA. baumanniiand A.nosocomialisin water samples collected from three selected rivers in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa. However, a few studies have reported similar cases in freshwater sources. In 2016, Maravic et al. [21] carried out a study in Croatia where an assessment of the microbial community in the urban riverine environment revealed 57 bacterial isolates belonging to the genusAcinetobacter[21] Likewise, Krizova et al. [32] showed a widespread distribution ofA. bohemicusin the water environment in the Czech Republic, whilstA. baumanniiwas characterized from a surface water resource in the South Nation River (SNR) drainage basin in Eastern Ontario, Canada [20] and in the freshwater aquaculture environment in China [33]. These reports across different geography indicated thatAcinetobacterspecies, includingA. baumannii, can survive in freshwater sources.PresumptiveAcinetobacterspecies (1107) recovered from three rivers in this study were further validated using molecular biology techniques targeting the specificrecAgene (425 bp) of theAcinetobactergenus [25]. PCR amplification assays based on therecAgene-specific primer identified 844Acinetobacterspecies, whilegyrBgene species-specific primers were employed to delineate them into species, namely,A. baumannii(410 isolates) andA. nosocomialis(23 isolates). Targeting both genes (recAandgyrB) to identify and delineateAcinetobacterspecies, respectively, was previously certified at 98.2% specificity and 92.4% sensitivity [25] and was commonly employed for the analysis ofAcinetobacterspecies. It has been applied for the analysis ofA. baumannii,A. nosocomialis, andA. pittii[34], known for multiple antibiotic resistant infections [2,25] in immune-compromised patients [2] and blood infection in a tertiary-care hospital [35]. However, there are a few reports on the occurrence ofA. baumanniiandA. nosocomialisin the aquatic environment [3,4], and this is perhaps due to the indiscriminate disposal of biomedical wastes into the environment and likely contamination of freshwater bodies. This portends a great risk to public health and among those living in the area and using water from these rivers for domestic and other purposes.The delineation of these pathogens into species gave room for additional analysis that is the determination of virulence traits. Therefore, virulence traits (afa/draBC,epsA,fimH,OmpA,PAI,sfa/focDE, andtraT) that could be detected inA. baumanniiandA. nosocomialisof clinical origin were investigated in the isolates from freshwater sources. Virulence genes are mechanisms by which bacteria initiate pathogenesis [36,37], especially in clinical settings. Pathogenesis and resistance to both antibiotics and harsh environments in nosocomialA. baumanniiandA. nosocomialisisolates have been linked to virulence factors [36]. The assessment of these environmental isolates (A. baumanniiandA. nosocomialis) for virulence genes using PCR assays revealed that both pathogens possessed certain numbers of the virulence factors (Table 4). Of the virulence factors considered in this study, theOmpAgene was predominantly exhibited byA. baumanniiisolates in all the rivers sampled. Likewise, thefimHandepsAgenes were detected in many of the isolates, but theafa/draBC,PAI,Sfa/focDE, andtraTgenes were detected in a few of the isolates. Comparably, the exhibition of virulence genes varies from one isolate to the other across the three rivers, which was also reported among clinical isolates known for nosocomial infections [38]. TheOmpAgene is the main outer membrane protein (OMP) located on theA. baumanniimembrane [39], which validates the findings of this current study that the virulence profiles of an individual isolate varied greatly and theOmpAgene was mostly detected [36].Generally, the outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria are made up of the OMPs, lipopolysaccharides, and phospholipid layers [37]. Studies have shown thatA. baumanniiusesOmpAfor adhesion to the lung epithelial cell by interacting with a cell cytoskeleton such as fibronectin on the cell surface and thereby inducing pneumonia [40]. It also causes cell death through caspase-3 activation [41]. Similarly,A. baumanniicould be responsible for apoptosis through the translocation of itsOmpAinto the mitochondria and nucleus of host cells [42]. The combination of the roles played byOmpAmakes it an important virulence factor in the pathogenesis ofA. baumanniiinfection. Moreover, antibiotic resistance inA. baumanniiis also associated withOmpA[43]. It was suggested thatOmpAwas involved in the removal of antibiotics from the periplasmic space membrane efflux systems [43]. The survival and persistence ofA. baumanniiin the cell are enhanced byOmpAdue to the formation of biofilms and surface motility. Therefore, the presence of theOmpAgene inA. baumanniisolates from freshwater sources is of a major concern based on its role in bacterial pathogenesis.5. ConclusionsThree selected freshwater sources in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, were evaluated for the distribution and virulence gene fingerprints of clinically relevantAcinetobacterspecies, namely,A. baumanniiandA. nosocomialis.OmpAwas the most prevalent virulence gene detected in theAcinetobacterspecies in all three rivers studied, followed by thefimHandepsAgenes, whereas thePAIandSfa/focDEgenes were the least exhibited, respectively. Furthermore, the number ofAcinetobacterspecies habouring the highest percentage of virulence genes was isolated from the Tyhume River followed by the Great Fish River, while Kieskamma River harboured the least. However, whilst previous reports have details on the virulence genes inA. baumanniiof clinical origin, such reports onA. baumanniifrom freshwater sources are limited. This study suggests that the aquatic environment is an important reservoir for pathogenicAcinetobacterspecies, similar to the hospital. As such, the identification of these opportunistic pathogens in freshwater sources requires public awareness and recognition as important to public health risks.Supplementary MaterialsThe following supporting information can be downloaded at:https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/bacteria3030011/s1, Figure S1.

        "abstract": "The current healthcare environment is at risk due to the facilitated transmission and empowerment of the ESKAPE pathogens, comprising of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species. These pathogens have posed significant challenges to global public health and the threat has only amplified over time. These multidrug-resistant bacteria have become adept at escaping the effects of conventional antibiotics utilized, leading to severe healthcare-associated infections and compromising immunocompromised patient outcomes to a greater extent. The impact of ESKAPE pathogens is evident in the rapidly rising rates of treatment failures, increased mortality, and elevated healthcare costs. To combat this looming crisis, diverse strategies have been adopted, ranging from the development of novel antimicrobial agents and combination therapies to the implementation of stringent infection control measures. Additionally, there has been a growing emphasis on promoting antimicrobial stewardship programs to optimize the use of existing antibiotics and reduce the selective pressure driving the evolution of resistance. While progress has been made to some extent, the rapid adaptability of these pathogens and the enhancement of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms proves to be a major hurdle yet to be crossed by healthcare professionals. In this viewpoint, the impending threat heralded by the proliferation of ESKAPE pathogens, and the need for a concerted global effort via international collaborations for the assurance of effective and sustainable solutions, are explored. To curb the possibility of outbreaks in the future and to safeguard public health, better preparation via global awareness and defense mechanisms should be given paramount importance.",

        "content": "1. IntroductionThe evolution of modern medicine has ushered in novel methods of treatment within the healthcare sphere, yet it brings an additional concern of microbial adaptability and immunity. Infections stemming from pathogens represent a formidable threat to patient well-being in hospital settings, typically recognized as centers for healing. These facilities, inadvertently, can transform into breeding grounds for various pathogens due to the close proximity of ailing individuals, invasive medical procedures, and the widespread utilization of medical devices [1]. The risk of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) escalates, particularly in the presence of immunocompromised patients, prolonged hospital stays, and the extensive, often unnecessary, administration of antibiotics [2]. This excessive use of antibiotics stands as a prominent factor contributing to the alarming surge in antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The overuse and misuse of different antibiotics in healthcare settings, where alternative methods could be adopted, significantly foster the development of multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains, amplifying the complexity of treating infections. The development of MDR strains is a complex and concerning phenomenon that emerges when microorganisms, predominantly bacteria, evolve various mechanisms to withstand the specific effects of the antibiotics they are exposed to which can render administered antibiotics highly weakened. Survival and proliferation are favored in strains that have adopted novel genetic mutations or mechanisms that confer heightened resistance to the drugs [3]. Over time, the surviving resistant strains become more prevalent, leading to the proliferation of MDR populations. Horizontal gene transfer, another crucial factor in the development of drug resistance, allows bacteria to share genetic material, including resistance genes, with one another [4]. This facilitates the rapid spread of traits that confer resistance within bacterial communities. Additionally, the widespread use of antibiotics in healthcare and community settings contributes to the environmental dissemination of resistant strains.Figure 1highlights the various mechanisms involved in the development of antibiotic resistance in bacteria.MDR strains utilize various resistance mechanisms that pose challenges to the efficacy of existing antibiotic treatments. Beta-lactamases and aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes are prevalent mechanisms that confer resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics and aminoglycosides, respectively [5,6]. Beta-lactamases, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases, hydrolyze beta-lactam rings, rendering antibiotics ineffective [7]. Aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes modify the structure of aminoglycoside antibiotics, reducing their binding affinity to bacterial ribosomes [8]. Target site mutations involve alterations in bacterial cellular structures, such as penicillin-binding proteins or ribosomal subunits, minimizing antibiotic binding and consequently inhibiting their action [9]. Efflux pumps actively expel antibiotics from bacterial cells, limiting intracellular drug concentrations. These pumps function as molecular machines that recognize and pump out a broad spectrum of antimicrobial agents, including antibiotics, from the bacterial cytoplasm [10]. These mechanisms collectively contribute to the resilience of multidrug-resistant bacteria, underscoring the importance of developing novel therapeutic strategies to combat the growing threat of AMR.The ESKAPE pathogens, consisting ofEnterococcus faecium,Staphylococcus aureus,Klebsiella pneumoniae,Acinetobacter baumannii,Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and variousEnterobacterspecies, are particularly noteworthy due to their adeptness at \u2018escaping\u2019 the effects of antimicrobial treatments and the efficient utilization of the commonly observed resistance mechanisms [11]. These pathogens have acquired resistance mechanisms against multiple classes of antibiotics, making them formidable adversaries in the battle against infectious diseases.E. faecium, for instance, has developed resistance to vancomycin, a last-resort antibiotic [12]. In 2018, the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network (EARS-Net) noted a significant increase in the mean proportion of vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (VRE) in invasive isolates within the European Union and European Economic Area (EU/EEA), rising from 10.4% in 2014 to 17.3% [13].S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA), poses a persistent challenge in healthcare settings [14]. The recent landmark publication of Cassini et al. estimated nearly 150,000 MRSA infections annually in the EU and EEA countries, leading to over 7000 attributable deaths [15].K. pneumoniaeis notorious for its resistance to carbapenems, crucial antibiotics used for severe infections [16]. MDR strains ofK. pneumoniaecause over 90,000 infections and 7000 deaths annually, and contribute to 25% of total disability-adjusted life years lost to bacterial infections in Europe alone [15,16].A. baumanniiexhibits resilience against a wide range of antibiotics, earning its designation as a \u201csuperbug\u201d [17]. Over the last two decades, global mortality rates for patients with carbapenem-resistant (CR), MDR or extensively drug-resistant (XDR)A. baumanniiinfections have varied from 24% to 83%, with individuals having multiple comorbidities facing an elevated risk of mortality, particularly from CRA. baumanniiinfection [18]. The pooled prevalence of MDRP. aeruginosacausing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was 33%, with varying rates across different regions, ranging from 19.7% in the USA to 87.5% in Iran, and a European prevalence of 29.9% [19]. In the case ofEnterobacterspp., according to predictive statistical models (Antimicrobial Resistance, 2022) [20], bacterial resistance in 2019 led to an estimated 4.95 million deaths, with 1.27 million directly attributed to resistance exhibited by Enterobacteriaceae bloodstream infections, alongside significant economic burdens per case of resistant infections [21]. The impact of these ESKAPE pathogens is profound, as AMR undermines the efficacy of conventional antibiotics. This translates to prolonged illnesses for patients, heightened mortality rates, and increased healthcare costs. Infections caused by these pathogens become increasingly difficult to treat, with limited options for effective antibiotics. The dire consequences of AMR extend beyond individual patient outcomes, affecting public health on a global scale.The practical consequences of AMR demonstrated by ESKAPE pathogens in clinical settings are deeply concerning and demand urgent attention. These pathogens can severely limit treatment options, and increase the risk of treatment failure and patient mortality. Moreover, the rise of AMR variants among these pathogens complicates infection control measures. Addressing this critical issue requires a multifaceted approach involving enhanced surveillance, judicious antibiotic use, the development of novel antimicrobial agents, and the promotion of infection prevention and control strategies to safeguard public health and ensure effective patient care. In this article, the rise and impact of ESKAPE pathogens, the methods currently utilized for eradication, the challenges posed and future perspectives are explored.2. Treatment and Control Measures Currently Implemented with LimitationsHospitals and healthcare units implement a range of treatment and control measures to address the contamination and proliferation of MDR strains, recognizing the critical importance of infection prevention and control. For instance, an audit of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) antimicrobial compliance utilizing an intervention bundle in the Sligo University Hospital (SUH) was collected in Ireland. For the study, patients from August to September 2018 were compared to a post-intervention prospective cohort from May to June 2019. The intervention included implementing a mobile audience response system, promoting an antimicrobial app, creating a physical card with local guidelines, and integrating CURB-65 into the unscheduled admission proforma. The local guidelines aligned with British Thoracic Society CAP guidelines. The results showed that overall compliance with local CAP guidelines significantly improved from 21.6% to 62.5%. Although there was no difference in initial intravenous antibiotic duration, the post-intervention group had a significantly shorter total antibiotic duration. No variations in length of stay or mortality were observed between the groups. Documentation of CURB-65 and streptococcal urinary antigen testing improved, suggesting that a simple, low-cost quality improvement bundle can enhance appropriate antimicrobial prescription and reduce the total antibiotic duration for CAP patients [22]. These measures are essential to safeguard patient safety and limit the spread of resistant strains. However, factors such as resource constraints, such as a lack of financial investments in personnel training, data management systems, and educational resources, and a small number of specialized personnel with training in infectious diseases, microbiology, pharmacy, and other relevant fields, has proven to be detrimental to the success of these endeavours. These limitations can lead to a shift in treatment determination and a lack of guideline adherence. These measures and their limitations involve the following.2.1. Antibiotic Stewardship ProgramsHospitals establish antibiotic stewardship programs (ASP) to promote the judicious use of antibiotics. They are crucial initiatives designed to optimize the antibiotic usage in healthcare settings. These programs aim to enhance patient outcomes while minimizing the development of antibiotic resistance and reducing unnecessary healthcare costs. Through the implementation of evidence-based practices, such as guidelines for appropriate antibiotic prescribing, education for healthcare professionals and patients, and robust monitoring systems, these programs seek to ensure that antibiotics are used judiciously and only when necessary. By promoting responsible antibiotic use, these stewardship programs play a pivotal role in preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics, safeguarding public health, and mitigating the growing global threat of antibiotic resistance. An ASP was implemented in urgent care clinics within an integrated academic health system, targeting non-antibiotic-appropriate acute respiratory tract infections (ARIs) while maintaining patient satisfaction. This initiative, launched in fiscal year 2020, involved developing measures, providing feedback, and educating clinicians and patients. Over three fiscal years, the antibiotic prescribing rate decreased significantly for visits subject to stewardship measures, dropping from 34% in FY19 to 12% in FY21. Similarly, antibiotic prescribing decreased for diagnosis-shifting visits from 63% to 35%, and overall antibiotic prescribing decreased from 30% to 10%. Despite challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, patient satisfaction at ARI visits increased from 83% in FY19 to 89% in FY20 and FY21, with no significant correlation found between antibiotic prescribing rates and patient satisfaction. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the ASP in reducing unnecessary antibiotic prescriptions while enhancing patient satisfaction in urgent care settings [23].Educating and screening patients before prescribing antibiotics helps prevent unnecessary antibiotic use in healthcare settings. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDCP) offer a useful screening checklist, considering factors such as clinical criteria for bacterial infection, patient allergies, and alternative treatments. Monitoring prescribing practices through programs like Plan\u2013Do\u2013Study Act (PDSA) can reduce antibiotic-resistant infections, while updating hospital policies on antimicrobial stewardship and limiting high-risk antibiotic use, are crucial steps. Hand hygiene practices and medication tracing ensure infection prevention and proper medication administration. Computerized alerts and probes aid in monitoring medication use, and the WHO\u2019s Digital Accelerator Kits facilitate the digitalization of guidance. The education of healthcare staff is essential for optimal clinical practice, emphasizing infection control and antibiotic stewardship. Ensuring the right drugs are used at the right time and promoting a culture of prevention through healthy behaviors and infection control measures are integral to effective ASPs. Organizational changes are necessary to implement these strategies effectively [24].Additionally, outbreak reports indicate that patients can be infected by organisms acquired from the hospital environment, offering insights into specific surfaces and areas within healthcare settings. However, the contribution of the hospital environment to HAIs remains debated, with many infections linked to patients\u2019 endogenous flora or direct transmission via healthcare providers\u2019 hands. Tracing transmission etiologies is challenging outside of intensive epidemiological investigations conducted during reported outbreaks. Despite evidence of environmental transmission, the role of a clean environment in HAI prevention is controversial, with surface cleaning viewed as complementary rather than a substitute for other infection control practices like hand hygiene. While the literature on environmental cleaning mainly originates from resource-rich countries, resource-limited settings face additional challenges, highlighting disparities in hospital environmental conditions worldwide. The WHOs minimum standards emphasize clean water, waste management, and visible dust and soil control as essential temporary measures for healthcare centers with limited resources, underscoring the need for global efforts to address disparities in hospital environmental hygiene standards. By implementing these mechanisms, healthcare facilities can enhance the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship practices, ultimately improving patient outcomes and mitigating the development of AMR [25].Figure 2highlights the various components of ASPs [26].2.1.1. Infection Prevention and Control PracticesHand hygiene: Proper hand hygiene is fundamental in preventing the spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Healthcare workers are trained to adhere to strict hand hygiene protocols, including the use of hand sanitizers and thorough handwashing techniques. A systematic review of data from 1980 to 2013 reported that improvements in hand hygiene compliance are associated with a reduction in HAIs in general and multidrug-resistant organisms, such as healthcare-associated MRSA infections in particular [27].However, despite rigorous training, achieving consistent compliance with hand hygiene protocols can be challenging. Healthcare workers may face time constraints, and busy work environments may contribute to lapses in adherence. Additionally, hand hygiene compliance may vary among different healthcare professionals. Over the last twenty years, research has revealed various factors linked to poor adherence to hand hygiene practices. Challenges like understaffing and overcrowding pose significant barriers to achieving optimal compliance levels, particularly exacerbated during outbreaks of infectious diseases. A study highlights that during the intervention phase, pre-pandemic follow-up, and follow-up during COVID-19, hand hygiene compliance (HHC) rates were 58%, 46%, and 34%, respectively. Comparisons showed a significant decrease in HHC during the pre-pandemic follow-up (46% vs. 58%,p< 0.0001) and the follow-up period during COVID-19 (34% vs. 58%,p< 0.0001) compared to the intervention phase. Despite the pandemic, HHC among healthcare workers significantly declined over time after management discontinued data presentation meetings. This study underscores the tendency of healthcare workers to revert to previous hand hygiene practices once improvement initiatives cease [28]. Additionally, a high workload is identified as another hindrance, particularly in healthcare environments with a substantial number of hand hygiene opportunities per hour of patient care, putting healthcare workers at a heightened risk of lower compliance. Research findings also indicate that doctors exhibit lower compliance compared to nurses in adhering to recommended hygiene practices. The act of wearing gloves is identified as a potential factor contributing to non-compliance, as it is sometimes mistakenly viewed as a replacement for proper hand hygiene. Improper use of gloves may create a false sense of protection and contribute to the transmission of pathogens. Despite clear discouragement of glove reuse in healthcare settings and the absence of a standardized reprocessing method, there is a concerning rise in glove reuse, particularly in resource-limited environments and during health crises [29].Isolation protocols: Isolation protocols utilized in healthcare settings currently include the allocation of private rooms (single occupancy) where infected or colonized patients are often placed in private rooms to minimize direct contact with other patients in the setting. This is particularly crucial when dealing with airborne or highly contagious pathogens. Another method includes the active cohorting of patients afflicted with similar strains, which can prevent the spread of the specific bacteria in question. This grouping strategy helps healthcare providers implement targeted infection control measures. However, placing patients in isolation may negatively impact their psychological well-being and overall experience. It can lead to feelings of isolation, increased anxiety, and a perceived lack of personalized care. Balancing infection control needs with patient-centered care is crucial. Most importantly, overcrowded hospitals often struggle to accommodate the influx of patients, leading to compromised infection prevention measures and increased risk of HAIs. The shortage of beds not only limits the ability to isolate infected individuals effectively but also places strain on healthcare staff to manage patient care efficiently. In crowded environments, the potential for cross-contamination escalates, as close proximity facilitates the spread of pathogens [30].Personal protective equipment (PPE): Healthcare workers may use PPE, such as gloves and gowns, when caring for patients with multidrug-resistant infections to minimize the risk of contamination, but the consistent use of PPE can be resource-intensive, requiring a constant supply of gloves, gowns, masks, and other protective gear. Some healthcare settings may face challenges in maintaining an adequate and sustainable supply, especially during periods of high demand [26]. For instance, in a study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic, the appropriate selection and rational use of PPE were shown to be essential to prevent supply shortages and reduce the risk of infection among healthcare workers. While PPE serves as a crucial protective measure, the study emphasized that it should be considered the last line of defense, complemented by effective administrative and engineering controls like the early identification of suspected cases and source control. Given the evolving understanding of transmission risks, PPE recommendations may change accordingly, underscoring the importance of healthcare facilities and healthcare workers staying informed and prepared for future updates [31].2.1.2. Environmental Cleaning and DisinfectionThe rigorous cleaning and disinfection of hospital environments are crucial to eliminate MDR bacteria on surfaces. Enhanced cleaning protocols are often implemented in areas where these bacteria may be prevalent. Environmental cleaning and disinfection in hospitals involve systematic processes to eliminate pathogens from surfaces and healthcare settings, preventing the spread of infections and ensuring a safe environment for patients and healthcare workers. This includes regular cleaning with detergents followed by targeted disinfection of high-touch surfaces using appropriate antimicrobial agents like chlorhexidine, povidone\u2013iodine, hexachlorophene, octenidine dihydrochloride and silver sulfadiazine [25].Antiseptic resistance and tolerance pose significant challenges in the realm of infection control, particularly in the context of MDR ESKAPE pathogens. While antibiotics primarily target bacterial cells, antiseptics and disinfectants are designed to eliminate microorganisms on surfaces and in the environment. However, some pathogens have developed mechanisms to resist or tolerate the effects of these chemical agents. In addition to the findings by Cai et al., it was discovered that exposure to ultraviolet C (UVC) radiation induced a significant portion ofAeromonas,Pseudomonas, andS. aureusinto the viable but nonculturable (VBNC) state. This transition was quantified through assays utilizing 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride flow cytometry (CTC-FCM) and D2O-labeled Raman spectroscopy. The VBNC state is characterized by bacterial cells that remain metabolically active but are unable to proliferate on standard culture media, posing challenges for traditional detection and eradication methods. This revelation underscores the importance of understanding bacterial responses to environmental stressors, particularly in the context of clinically relevant pathogens such as those belonging to the ESKAPE group [32]. These pathogens, notorious for their ability to evade antimicrobial treatments, may exploit mechanisms such as entering the VBNC state to persist in healthcare environments, potentially leading to recurrent infections and complicating infection control measures.Additionally, wastewater systems, particularly those exposed to hospital or livestock wastewater, have been identified as major reservoirs of epidemic pathogens associated with high-risk clones. These includeE. faeciumstrains belonging to the high-risk Enterococcal clonal complex (HiRECC) [33],A. baumanniiclones carrying OXA-23 (belonging to international clone 2, IC2) and OXA-72 (belonging to international clone 1, IC1) [34],K. pneumoniaestrains of sequence types (ST) 11 and 258 [35] andP. aeruginosastrains of ST235, ST111, and ST175. These findings underscore the potential role of wastewater systems as significant contributors to the dissemination of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Therefore, comprehensive strategies that encompass both conventional and innovative approaches are essential for effectively managing ESKAPE pathogens and minimizing their impact on public health [36].2.1.3. Surveillance Programs with Patient/Staff EducationHospitals may implement active surveillance programs to identify patients carrying MDR bacteria upon admission. This allows for early detection and appropriate infection control measures [37]. The continuous monitoring of the prevalence of these resistant strains is essential to track their dynamics over time, identify emerging resistance patterns, and inform timely adjustments to control measures. Examples of surveillance protocols include routine screening of patients for MDR organisms, analyzing antimicrobial susceptibility patterns, and molecular typing to trace the spread of specific strains [38]. Surveillance data not only aid in understanding the prevalence and distribution of MDR strains but also helps identify potential risk factors and sources of transmission within healthcare facilities. For instance, if surveillance reveals an uptick in a particular MDR strain in a specific hospital unit, targeted interventions, such as increased screening, enhanced environmental cleaning, and reinforced staff training, can be implemented to contain the spread [39]. Collaborative efforts between researchers, clinicians, and public health agencies enhance the ability to stay ahead of evolving resistance patterns. In this way, surveillance becomes an integral part of a proactive approach to combatting MDR bacteria, influencing hospital protocols by providing real-time insights that guide decision-making, resource allocation, and the optimization of infection control practices. [36,40].Surveillance programs, while valuable, may have limitations in detecting all carriers of MDR bacteria. False negatives can occur, leading to potential underestimation of the actual prevalence. For instance, in a study the limitations of national surveillance systems addressing antimicrobial resistance in Europe encompass three primary areas: structural challenges, issues with laboratory-based surveillance, and inadequate coordination with animal and food surveillance programs. These systems often suffer from a lack of coordination, standardization, and harmonization, which impedes effective data collection, sharing, and collaboration. This comprehensive study analyzing 24 national and 14 regional surveillance systems across 19 European countries unveiled significant discrepancies in reporting practices and adherence to international guidelines. Despite the potential benefits of point-prevalence surveys and laboratory-based surveillance, the delayed publication of data diminishes their practicality for timely decision-making and resource allocation. Furthermore, only a minority of surveillance systems offer real-time access to resistance data, underscoring the pressing need for enhanced data accessibility and timeliness [40]. This emphasizes the need for a combination of surveillance methods for improved accuracy. Ongoing research and surveillance efforts also require substantial resources, including funding, skilled personnel, and advanced laboratory facilities. Some healthcare settings, particularly those with limited resources, may struggle to maintain comprehensive surveillance programs consistently.Education is a key component in the fight against MDR bacteria. Hospitals conduct educational programs for both healthcare staff and patients to raise awareness about the importance of infection prevention, proper antibiotic use, and the potential consequences of MDR infections [41]. The impact of educational programs on long-term behavior change may be challenging to sustain. Continuous reinforcement and adaptation of educational strategies are necessary to keep healthcare professionals and patients consistently aware of the importance of infection prevention and prudent antibiotic use [42]. It empowers patients to understand the appropriate use of antibiotics, reducing antibiotic prescriptions and informed patients are more likely to adhere to treatment plans, minimizing the development of resistant strains. Additionally, educating healthcare staff ensures consistent adherence to antimicrobial stewardship protocols, leading to better patient outcomes and preserving the effectiveness of antibiotics for future generations [43].Table 1summarizes the measures implemented and the obstacles and flaws involved.3. Effects of ASP on ESKAPE PathogensRecognizing the formidable threat posed by ESKAPE pathogens, ASPs play a pivotal role in promoting responsible antibiotic use, curbing resistance, and ensuring effective infection control measures in healthcare environments. The cases highlight the effectiveness and limitations of these programs in the context of ESKAPE pathogens in a clinical environment. Some of the cases are extensively tabulated inTable 2.4. Future Measures for Successful MitigationWhile the measures currently implemented can be fine-tuned for the mitigation of MDR bacteria, a few more measures can be implemented for their effective eradication. Addressing the prevalence of ESKAPE pathogens necessitates a comprehensive approach, including stringent hygiene practices, judicious antibiotic use, and ongoing research to develop novel antimicrobial agents.Addressing the challenge of multidrug-resistant bacteria requires a forward-looking approach that involves innovative measures and a comprehensive strategy. Below are potential measures that could be implemented in the future to aid in the successful mitigation of multidrug-resistant bacteria.4.1. Incentives for Novel Antibiotic DevelopmentDedicating resources to research and development is crucial for the discovery and creation of novel antibiotics that boast distinctive mechanisms of action. This investment fosters innovation in the pharmaceutical industry, driving the pursuit of antibiotics less susceptible to resistance. By incentivizing the development of antibiotics with a lower likelihood of resistance, we can fortify our arsenal against evolving microbial threats [57]. Miethke et al. recommend the establishment of an international coalition of experienced advocates for AMR. The Global AMR R&D Hub is proposed as a central hub for coordinating such efforts, supported by various consortia, including the authors\u2019 initiative, the International Research Alliance for Antibiotic Discovery and Development (IRAADD). This alliance aligns with the mission outlined in the current roadmap and has received backing from the JPIAMR Virtual Research Institute [58]. By offering funding, governments and organizations encourage pharmaceutical companies to allocate resources to antibiotic research, which is often financially challenging due to the high costs and lengthy timelines involved [59]. Making the research and development costs more manageable, tax credits can encourage sustained efforts in this critical area [60]. This approach addresses concerns about the financial viability of antibiotic development by ensuring a return on investment for pharmaceutical companies [61]. For instance, initiatives like public\u2013private partnerships can leverage the strengths of both sectors, pooling resources and expertise to address the challenges associated with antibiotic development. These collaborations can lead to joint research efforts, shared infrastructure, and accelerated development timelines [62].The development of novel antibiotics for ESKAPE pathogens remains challenging due to the rapid emergence of multidrug resistance and difficulties in identifying new drug targets. This poses a significant threat to global health as effective treatment options dwindle. Consequently, researchers are exploring alternative strategies, such as drug repurposing, to combat antibiotic resistance and extend the usefulness of existing antibiotics. Drug repurposing offers a cost-effective approach to combat antibiotic resistance while extending the lifespan of existing antibiotics. For instance, research discovered BMS-833923 (a phosphatidylglycerol-selective adjuvant to colistin) as a potent compound that directly kills Gram-positive bacteria and enhances colistin\u2019s effectiveness against Gram-negative strains. BMS showed no evidence of inducing antibiotic resistance and effectively treated drug-resistant bacteria in tests by disrupting membranes. This study suggests BMS as a promising antibacterial candidate against Gram-positive pathogens like MRSA and VRE, and as an adjunct to bolster colistin\u2019s activity against various Gram-negative pathogens, including multidrug-resistant strains and ESKAPE pathogens [63]. Additionally, encouraging pharmaceutical companies to explore neglected or underexplored classes of antibiotics can broaden the spectrum of available treatments. The pursuit of antibiotics with decreased resistance potential aligns with global health goals and addresses the urgent need for sustainable solutions to combat bacterial infections. For instance, a comprehensive review discusses the current utilization of quinolones for these pathogens, their subsequent deterioration and the need for various quinolone hybrids with different heterocyclic moieties, exploring their potential as antibacterial agents. The article highlights the effectiveness of quinolone\u2013thiazole/thiadiazole hybrids, which exhibit antibacterial effects by inhibiting bacterial cell wall and folic acid synthesis. Quinolone\u2013oxadiazole/oxazolidinone hybrids are emphasized for their unique mechanism of action in protein synthesis. The study also explores quinolone hybrids with 1,2,3-/1,2,4-triazole/tetrazole, imidazole, pyrimidine/pyridine/quinazolinone, sulfonamide/sulfonyl hydrazide/sulfenamide, kanglemycin/macrolide, isatin/quinoline, and miscellaneous compounds. Notable findings include promising antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin/norfloxacin-1,2,3-triazole hybrids and ciprofloxacin\u2013isatin hybrids against a range of pathogens. Additionally, hybrids like 2-quinolone\u2013thiazole\u2013coumarin demonstrated profound activity against specific antibiotic-resistant strains [64].4.2. Interdisciplinary ResearchPromoting collaborative and interdisciplinary research is essential for devising comprehensive strategies to combat multidrug-resistant bacteria. This approach involves fostering collaboration among experts from diverse fields such as microbiology, epidemiology, pharmacology, and social sciences. By pooling the expertise of researchers from these distinct disciplines, a more holistic understanding of the multifaceted challenges posed by multidrug-resistant bacteria can be achieved [65]. For example, microbiologists can contribute by delving into the genetic and molecular aspects of antibiotic resistance mechanisms, while epidemiologists can provide insights into the spread and dynamics of resistant strains within populations. Pharmacologists play a crucial role in studying the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of antimicrobial agents, helping to optimize dosages and treatment regimens. Social scientists contribute valuable perspectives on behavioral factors, public awareness, and healthcare infrastructure, influencing the success of interventions [66].This interdisciplinary collaboration not only broadens the scope of research but also enhances the potential for innovative solutions. Understanding the socio-cultural factors influencing antibiotic misuse can guide the development of targeted public awareness campaigns, promoting responsible antibiotic use. Moreover, this collaborative approach fosters a more robust and adaptable response to the evolving challenges posed by MDR bacteria, ensuring that strategies are not only effective but also sustainable in diverse settings. Overall, encouraging interdisciplinary research is a key element in the concerted effort to address the complex issue of antibiotic resistance.4.3. Alternative Therapies and Treatment ModalitiesIn advocation for the exploration of innovative therapeutic approaches beyond traditional antibiotics, recognizing the need for diversified strategies in combating bacterial infections is experiencing a boom. Examples of these alternative approaches include phage therapy, which utilizes bacteriophages to specifically target and eliminate bacteria, offering a promising avenue for treatment. Additionally, monoclonal antibodies, designed to target specific bacterial components, and immunotherapies, harnessing the body\u2019s immune system to combat infections, are suggested as potential alternatives or complementary options to conventional antibiotic treatments [67].Phage therapy, in particular, involves the use of bacteriophages, which are viruses that infect and kill bacteria. These viruses can be tailored to target specific bacterial strains, providing a highly targeted and precise method for combating infections [68]. Monoclonal antibodies, on the other hand, are laboratory-created molecules designed to bind to specific targets on bacteria, enhancing the immune system\u2019s ability to recognize and eliminate them. Immunotherapies aim to bolster the body\u2019s natural defenses against bacterial infections, potentially offering a more sustainable and adaptive approach to treatment [69].By diversifying the arsenal of therapeutic options to include these innovative approaches, the medical community aims to address the challenges posed by antibiotic resistance while improving treatment efficacy and minimizing adverse effects. This holistic exploration of alternative strategies represents a crucial step towards a more comprehensive and sustainable approach to managing bacterial infections in the face of increasing antibiotic resistance.4.4. Precision Medicine for Infectious DiseasesPrecision medicine, also known as personalized medicine, is an innovative approach to healthcare that tailors medical treatment and interventions to individual characteristics, such as genetic makeup, molecular profiles, and environmental factors. In the context of multidrug-resistant pathogens, precision medicine seeks to develop targeted therapies and interventions that are specifically designed to address the unique characteristics of each patient\u2019s infection [70]. Some of these methods include-Genetic variability: Precision medicine often involves genomic analysis to identify genetic variations in pathogens that contribute to drug resistance. For example, the identification of specific mutations in the genes responsible for antibiotic targets can inform the development of drugs that overcome these resistance mechanisms. In the case ofMycobacterium tuberculosis, whole-genome sequencing can reveal mutations associated with resistance to anti-tuberculosis drugs, guiding the selection of personalized treatment regimens [71].-Tailored treatments: Precision medicine aims to develop drugs that specifically target the vulnerabilities of multidrug-resistant pathogens. The use of targeted therapies, such as monoclonal antibodies, that focus on specific components of the bacterial cell wall can be explored for bacteria like MRSA [72].-Pharmacogenomic studies: They can help understand how an individual\u2019s genetic makeup influences their response to medications, aiding in the selection of the most effective and least toxic drugs. Identifying genetic markers associated with resistance to certain antibiotics can guide clinicians in choosing alternative drugs for treating infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria [73,74].-Host factors: Precision medicine recognizes the importance of host\u2013pathogen interactions and incorporates host factors into treatment strategies. Understanding the host\u2019s immune response and genetic factors can inform the development of immunotherapies or adjunctive therapies that enhance the host\u2019s ability to combat infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens [75].4.5. Technological InnovationsIn the ongoing effort to combat antimicrobial resistance, this study emphasizes the importance of integrating advanced technologies into healthcare practices. Notably, the incorporation of cutting-edge tools like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and rapid diagnostic tools has proven instrumental in augmenting the early detection of multidrug-resistant strains [76].Artificial intelligence plays a pivotal role by analyzing vast datasets to identify patterns and trends that might be indicative of drug resistance. Machine learning algorithms, through continuous learning and adaptation, contribute to refining diagnostic capabilities, making them more accurate and efficient over time. Rapid diagnostic tools, leveraging the latest technological advancements, enable healthcare professionals to swiftly identify specific resistance mechanisms, facilitating targeted and precise treatment decisions [77].For instance, AI algorithms can analyze patient data, including previous antibiotic exposure and microbial genomic information, to predict the likelihood of drug resistance. Machine learning models can adapt to evolving resistance patterns, providing real-time insights into the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. Rapid diagnostic tools, equipped with advanced molecular techniques, can quickly identify genetic markers associated with resistance, allowing for tailored interventions [78].The synergy of these advanced technologies not only enhances the speed and accuracy of detecting multidrug-resistant strains but also enables healthcare providers to adopt a more targeted and effective approach in prescribing antimicrobial treatments. This integration represents a promising step forward in the battle against antimicrobial resistance, emphasizing the need for a comprehensive and technologically advanced approach to safeguard public health.4.6. Global Surveillance NetworksThe establishment and enhancement of global surveillance networks play a pivotal role in combating the spread of multidrug-resistant strains, providing a comprehensive approach to monitor resistance patterns and fostering timely information sharing across healthcare facilities, regions, and countries. One key aspect of these networks involves the systematic collection and analysis of data on antimicrobial resistance. By leveraging advanced technologies and collaborative efforts, countries and healthcare facilities can contribute information on emerging resistance trends, enabling the identification of hotspots and high-risk areas. For instance, a global surveillance network might involve the real-time monitoring of antibiotic usage, genetic sequencing of resistant strains, and sharing of treatment outcomes [79].International collaborations, such as the Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS), exemplify the effectiveness of such networks. GLASS, coordinated by the WHO, brings together data from various countries, allowing for a comprehensive understanding of global resistance patterns. Through shared information, participating nations can adapt their antimicrobial stewardship programs to align with emerging threats, enhancing their ability to respond effectively. In their report for the European region in 2020, it has been reported that surveillance of nosocomial infections, antimicrobial consumption (AMC), and AMR has been ongoing in EU and EEA countries for nearly two decades, providing valuable trends for policymakers. In 2011, the European Strategic Action Plan highlighted the need for systematic data collection on AMC and AMR in non-EU/EEA countries, leading to the establishment of the AMC and CAESAR networks by the WHO Regional Office for Europe and partner institutions. The CAESAR Network, established in 2012, aids 19 countries in improving laboratory testing and data management for AMR surveillance, with 11 countries currently submitting data. Annual meetings and joint conferences have facilitated collaboration and technical support. Moreover, GLASS includes 25 European Region countries, with plans for further expansion and targeted interventions, such as promoting systematic antibiotic susceptibility testing. Successful pilot projects have already been conducted in Georgia and Armenia, with ongoing initiatives in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan [80].Moreover, these networks facilitate the exchange of best practices in antimicrobial stewardship and infection control strategies. For instance, a healthcare facility in one region, facing success in reducing antibiotic resistance through a specific intervention, can share its experience with counterparts globally. This knowledge exchange fosters a collaborative learning environment, enabling healthcare providers worldwide to adopt successful strategies and tailor them to their local contexts. Timely information sharing is critical during outbreaks of multidrug-resistant strains, as demonstrated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The rapid dissemination of data enabled a more effective global response. Similarly, a robust global surveillance network for antimicrobial resistance would expedite the identification of emerging threats, allowing for proactive measures to mitigate the spread of resistant strains.4.7. One Health ApproachEmbracing a holistic and comprehensive \u201cOne Health\u201d approach is paramount in combating antibiotic resistance, acknowledging the intricate links between human health, animal health, and the environment. This approach advocates for collaborative efforts across various sectors, including human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and environmental health. By fostering synergy among these domains, strategies can be developed to tackle the broader ecosystem that contributes to the rise of antibiotic resistance [81]. For instance, in veterinary medicine, responsible antibiotic use in livestock is crucial. This involves implementing judicious prescribing practices, monitoring antibiotic consumption, and adopting vaccination strategies to reduce the need for antibiotics. In agriculture, promoting sustainable farming practices, such as organic farming and rotational grazing, can mitigate the overuse of antibiotics in animals raised for food production [82].Environmental health considerations encompass understanding how antibiotic residues in water sources can contribute to resistance. Efforts to manage pharmaceutical waste, improve wastewater treatment, and reduce environmental contamination play a pivotal role in preventing the spread of antibiotic resistance. By integrating these diverse elements under the One Health umbrella, a more robust defense against antibiotic resistance can be established. The collaborative approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between human health, animal health, and the environment, leading to more effective strategies to address the multifaceted challenges posed by antibiotic resistance [83].Most importantly, methods to evaluate global AMR utilizing the One Health approach prove to be enlightening. For example, this study aimed to develop a comprehensive evaluation tool for global AMR using a One Health approach. Incorporating data from 146 countries, the Global One Health Index (GOHI)\u2013AMR scheme was developed, comprising five key indicators and 49 sub-indicators. Results showed that high-income countries (HICs) generally performed better on AMR indicators compared to lower-income countries, with unexpected variations among income groups. GOHI-AMR scores correlated positively with gross domestic product and life expectancy but negatively with natural growth rate and chronic respiratory disease. Significant disparities were observed within and between countries, emphasizing the need for tailored interventions. Notably, collaborations between countries like China and Russia demonstrated promising outcomes. This study underscores the importance of global collaboration and provides targeted recommendations to enhance AMR management in low-ranking countries, positioning GOHI-AMR as a valuable tool for global AMR assessment and intervention planning [84].Implementing these measures requires a concerted effort from governments, healthcare systems, pharmaceutical industries, researchers, and the public. The complex nature of antibiotic resistance demands a multifaceted and collaborative approach to ensure the successful mitigation of multidrug-resistant bacteria in the future.5. ConclusionsThe landscape of modern medicine has indeed transformed healthcare, ushering in innovative treatments that, unfortunately, bring forth the escalating challenge of microbial adaptability and immunity. While hospitals have traditionally been sanctuaries for healing, certain factors such as close patient proximity, invasive medical procedures, and the extensive use of medical devices can unintentionally turn them into breeding grounds for pathogens. The surge in HAIs, exacerbated by prolonged hospital stays and unnecessary antibiotic administration, has played a pivotal role in the alarming rise of AMR. The emergence of drug-resistant strains, a complex and concerning phenomenon, is rooted in the selective pressure exerted by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics. This process favors the survival and proliferation of microbial strains with heightened resistance, adding layers of complexity to infection treatment. The notorious ESKAPE pathogens, adept at \u2018escaping\u2019 antimicrobial treatments, pose a formidable challenge. Their resistance spans multiple classes of antibiotics, including last-resort options, underscoring the urgent need to address AMR. The repercussions of AMR extend beyond individual patient outcomes, impacting global public health with prolonged illnesses, heightened mortality rates, and increased healthcare costs. In this evolving landscape, a concerted effort is imperative to mitigate the impact of AMR and safeguard the efficacy of current and future antimicrobial treatments for clinical applications.To confront these challenges, a comprehensive approach is indispensable. Stringent hygiene practices, judicious antibiotic use, regulatory and governmental initiatives, and ongoing research for new antimicrobial agents are crucial components. This multifaceted strategy not only addresses the evolving threats posed by ESKAPE pathogens but also ensures the sustainability of our ability to combat infectious diseases amid increasing antimicrobial resistance. It is crucial to recognize the urgency of this issue and to foster international collaboration, research initiatives, and public awareness to curb the growing impact of ESKAPE pathogens on global health. The continuous evolution and spread of antimicrobial resistance underscore the importance of proactive measures to mitigate the challenges posed by these elusive and resilient microorganisms. International programs including global collaborations, education, and public awareness efforts are pivotal in this ongoing battle to safeguard global health. As we navigate the complexities of MDR bacteria, measures like global awareness and defense mechanisms offer a beacon of hope for a future where effective treatments remain within our grasp for public health and well-being.Author ContributionsConceptualization, methodology, software, validation, formal analysis, investigation, resources, data curation, visualization and writing\u2014original draft preparation, B.S. and K.R.; writing\u2014review and editing and supervision, B.S.

        "abstract": "Maize silks (style) receive wind-transmitted pollen. Thereafter, male gametes travel through the silks to reach ovules. Pollinated silks contain a microbiome, members of which are predicted to promote host reproduction and abiotic/biotic stress tolerance during fertilization. It is unknown whether pollinated silk bacteria originate environmentally (air/pollen) or from maternal tissue. Methods are lacking to test microbial colonization of silks in their native habitat [on intact maize inflorescences (cobs) encased by husk leaves]. Current methods focus on naked silks attached to dehusked cob pieces. Here, two novel methods are presented to enable research on silk microbes in their native habitat. Method 1 tests whether silk-associated bacteria with potential environmental origins are attracted toward ovules. Method 2 distinguishes whether a microbe colonizes silks from the environment or maternal parent. Biosafety containment was enabled by housing microbe-treated cobs in large jars. Using these methods, a model bacterial isolate from fertilization-stage silks (DsRed-tagged Pantoea-E04) was shown to colonize husk-covered silks after inoculating exposed silk tips; E04 could not colonize from the cob base, suggesting an environmental origin. In support, E04 colonized silks more frequently when cobs were uncut and oriented vertically. These protocols will enable more biologically relevant investigation of silk microbiomes and pathogens.",

        "content": "1. IntroductionStyles form the female reproductive tract of flowering plants, through which male gametes travel to eventually fertilize an ovule [1]. The male gametes originate from pollen and use elongating pollen tubes that grow through the style to achieve fertilization [2,3]. Maize has uniquely long styles, commonly known as silks, that make it a model system for studying style biology. Maize silk initiates from the ovule, protected by husk leaves, and grows toward the environment to capture pollen, eventually emerging from the tip of the ear of maize; hence, it exhibits clear directionality (polarity) in its growth [2].There is emerging interest in the microbes that live on or in maize silks, which may promote silk health and host reproduction [4] or may protect developing seeds (derived from ovules) from environmental pathogens that use silks as a passageway [5,6,7,8]. A microbe that inhabits a sub-surface tissue is known as an endophyte [9,10].Some studies have investigated the vertical transmission of endophytic microbes in plants, where bacteria are transmitted from a parent to progeny via the seeds [11,12]. Endophytes are also transmitted horizontally, for example, from the surrounding environment, sometimes with insect vectors, similar to the horizontal transmission of pathogens [13,14]. Pollen-based microbe transmission has also been proposed [15,16,17]. There are many endophytic microbes in pollinated maize silks, many of which may be beneficial to maize [4,6,7,8]. Bacterial taxa that have the potential for plant growth promotion and nitrogen fixation have also been found in maize pollen [18,19]. It is possible that silk endophytes come from multiple sources, including the environment (horizontal transmission), pollen/pollen tubes (vertical transmission), and endogenously from the maternal plant (possibly originating from seed or soil via the vascular system). However, the origin of maize silk-associated microbes is unknown. The fate of bacteria associated with fertilization-stage silks is also unknown, specifically whether they migrate toward the seed, which is of importance to understanding their vertical transmission to progeny (e.g., if derived from pollen).We hypothesize that the origin and fate of specific silk-associated microbes can be investigated by tracking the direction of bacterial migration on cobs and silks, specifically to differentiate whether (1) they are competent to migrate from silk tips (environment) to the base (toward the seed), suggestive of transmission from the environment or pollen; or alternatively, (2) they are competent to migrate from the base of the cob through its vascular system into the silk base toward the tip, suggestive of a maternal origin.The general purpose of this study was to design methods to track bacterial migration on cobs and silks. Previous microscopic protocols have observed bacteria and/or pathogenic fungi on maize silks that remained attached to dissected cob segments [20,21], but methods for observing microbial colonization on silks attached to intact cobs are lacking. Presumably, intact cobs with their protective husk leaves more closely resemble the native habitat of silk endophytes. Furthermore, the use of young cobs may ensure that the host material is metabolically alive to support microbes. To our knowledge, there are no existing techniques for tracking bacterial migration on intact cobs. Briefly, the methods that will be presented here involve the application of fluorescently tagged bacteria to intact maize cobs, which are incubated in large glass jars. The cobs are then dissected, and silk segments are ground and plated onto selective media to determine the colonization patterns of the bacteria.Maize silks have native bacteria [4,6,7,8], as already mentioned, and hence, to distinguish any bacterium of interest, it must be tagged, such as in this study, with a fluorescent protein. Here, a model bacterial isolate was tagged with DsRed (Addgene, 111257) and used in this case study to demonstrate the new methods. The isolate was referred to as E04 (Pantoeasp.) and was selected for a number of reasons. First, it was isolated from fertilization-stage maize silks and exhibited the potential to provide multiple benefits to the host maize, as well as adaptations to stressors in the silk/pollen environments, and potential for vertical transmission [4,7,8]. Bacterial isolate E04 was recently shown to be tolerant to 10% poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG-6000) as a proxy for desiccation/drought tolerance; to produce indole compounds as a proxy for indoleacetic acid (IAA; an auxin), which may stimulate egg maturation/silk growth; and could grow anaerobically without nitrogen, which may indicate nitrogen fixation ability or capacity to survive in low-nutrient environments [4]. Isolate E04 also contains genes involved in osmoprotectant biosynthesis and transport, indole-3-acetic acid biosynthesis, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA, \u03b3-aminobutyrate) import, and aluminum and acid tolerance; these genes may help with bacterial survival and/or promote host reproduction [4]. The E04 genetic sequence matches a 16S V4-MiSeq OTU sequence that was previously predicted to be a member of the core maize silk microbiome and aFusarium graminearumindicator based on analyses of the silks of 14 North American maize genotypes [6,7,8]. Isolate E04 was observed colonizing maize silks externally and internally, including at wound sites [8,21]. Isolate E04 was also concluded to be safe based on susceptibility to multiple antibiotics, whole-genome mining for virulence genes, and biosafety risk group. Thus, this bacterium has potential as a multi-functional microbial treatment in plants, and its interactions with maize should be studied. Whether strain E04 enters silks from maternal parent tissue or the environment was unknown, and hence, it was tested here using both original methods.The specific objective of the current study was to test and present two novel methods to track bacteria in young, intact cobs with their husk leaves using model isolate E04. Method 1 is intended to test whether a silk-associated bacterium may have an environmental origin (including pollen) and/or is attracted to the ovule (future seed after fertilization) by applying bacteria to the tip of the cob. Method 1 also tests the impact of cob orientation and silk cutting on bacterial colonization of silks. In this method, bacteria are inoculated from the exposed silk tip, and then colonization is measured along silk segments. Method 2 is broader and is intended to distinguish whether a microbe is able to colonize silks if inoculated from the silk tips (implicating an environmental/pollen origin) versus the base of the cob (implicating a maternal parent origin). These methods are intended to allow researchers to investigate a variety of silk-inhabiting microbes and to improve the collective understanding of the plant reproductive microbiome.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Sources of Biological MaterialsSource of maize cobs: For the first experiment, PHRE1 inbred maize (Pioneer Hi-Bred, Johnston, IA, USA) was planted at the Elora Research Station (University of Guelph, Elora, ON, Canada) as described in [21], and cobs with young, emerged silks were harvested. All cobs were harvested on the same day and were grouped by similar maturity for each replicate. For the second experiment, LH82 inbred maize was sequentially planted at the University of Guelph Crop Science Greenhouse Facility under the conditions described in [8] and [21]. Cobs were young, intact, and husk-covered to ensure silks were alive and growing and to reflect the native habitat of silk-associated microbes.Source of bacterial strain: Isolate E04 (Pantoeasp., NCBI GenBank biosample number SAMN37538673, accession number JAWILD000000000) was isolated from pollinated, field-grown maize silks [7,8]. This isolate was selected based on previous microbiome and functional analyses as described above, making E04 a highly relevant strain for future crop treatments and microbiome breeding programs. The isolate was transformed with tetracycline (Tet)-resistant plasmids pSW002-PpsbA-DsRed-Express2 (DsRed) (Addgene, 111257), as previously described [8,21].2.2. Method 1: Testing the Ability of a Microbe to Be Taken Up from the Environment, Colonize Silks, and Subsequently Migrate Toward OvulesMethod 1 is intended to test whether a silk-associated bacterium is able to colonize from the environment (implicating a possible air or pollen origin) and subsequently migrate toward the ovule (silk base, future seed after fertilization). In this method, fluorescently tagged bacteria were inoculated on the exposed silk tips of intact, husk-covered maize cobs, which were incubated in large jars (Figure 1), and then colonization was measured by dissecting silk segments and culturing them on selective media. Bacteria were inoculated onto cut/uncut silks attached to intact, husk-covered maize silks on cobs that were placed either vertically or horizontally (Figure 1). Uncut silks were tested to mimic their natural field condition. Cut silks were also tested in case this impacted bacterial colonization at the exposed wound site; here, the emerged silk tips were trimmed down to the husk. The cut silks continued to grow during the 5 d incubation and extended beyond the end of the husks, indicating that the silks were still alive after the ear was removed from the stalk (Figure 1C, inset). Hence, the approach used represents an in vitro live tissue assay. It was also tested whether orienting the cobs vertically or horizontally affected the assay. Vertically oriented cobs reflect their positioning when attached to the maize stalk in modern hybrids. If a tip-inoculated bacterium migrates toward the base when the cob is positioned vertically, it would be significant since the transpiration stream and parental metabolites flow in the opposite direction [22]. The horizontal cob orientation was added to understand, for example, the natural assistance of gravity on bacterial migration.A single, fluorescently tagged isolate of particular interest (DsRed-tagged E04,Pantoea) was evaluated for its ability to colonize silks when inoculated on exposed silk tips attached to young, freshly harvested, intact maize cobs in autoclaved glass jars with lids (1 gallon, ~3.785 L, Catalog #S-19317B-M, Uline, Canada). The bacterium was evaluated for its ability to colonize the husk-enclosed silks after being applied onto uncut or cut silks of cobs, which were placed horizontally or upright.For upright cobs, 50 mL Falcon tubes were taped to the inside of the glass jar. E04 bacterial liquid cultures were centrifuged at 4000\u00d7gfor 4 min, washed in 10 mM Tris-HCl thrice, and resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl to an OD600reading of 0.2\u20130.5 (typically ~0.4). Subsequently, 2 mL of resuspended E04 liquid culture was applied via pipette to the exposed silks (cut or uncut) of cobs (placed horizontally or vertically) from which only the first layer of outer husk leaves had been removed, leaving the cob covered with many layers of husk leaves.Jars were sealed for 5 d, and then the cobs were dissected. The external silks were discarded, the husk leaves were carefully removed, and silks that had been contained within the husk were cut into base, middle, and tip segments using sterile razor blades (seeFigure 1). Silks were transferred into sterile mortar and pestles, ground with 2 mL Tris-HCl, and 100 \u00b5L was immediately plated onto lysogeny broth (LB) plates containing Tet (150 \u00b5L at 0.3 \u00b5g/\u00b5L pipetted on top and dried) and incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 5 d. The plates were then examined for fluorescent colonies under UV light, photographed, and quantified.2.3. Method 2: Method to Test the Competency of a Microbe to Colonize Silks from the Environment (Silk Tips) Versus from the Maternal Parent (Cob Base)Method 2 is intended to distinguish whether a microbe is able to colonize silks when inoculated from the silk tips (inferring a possible environmental origin including pollen) versus the base of the cob (inferring a maternal parent origin). In this secondary experiment, 2 mL of 10 mM Tris-HCl-washed bacteria with an OD600reading of ~0.45 (0.41\u20130.49) was dispensed into the bottom of the Falcon tubes in some of the jars, and the base of the cob was placed into the bacterial liquid culture (no treatment onto the exposed silks). In parallel, the silk tips were inoculated with additional precautions to prevent contamination at the cob base. The cobs for these silk tip inoculations were temporarily placed with the silk-end submerged in separate Falcon tubes containing E04 bacterial liquid culture for 6 min, followed by the cobs sitting horizontally for 5 min to allow any excess bacteria to drip off, and then the cobs were placed vertically upright in a clean, dry, empty Falcon tube inside the jar. This experiment was also used to control the artifact of excess bacterial liquid culture dripping down the outside of husks in Method 1 so that one could be confident that the bacteria had entered via the exposed silk tips and were not taken up through the vascular system at the base of the cobs. All cobs in this test were uncut and vertical, as these conditions were found to promote silk colonization in Method 1, and these conditions also represent the natural state of cobs in the field. Jars were sealed for 5 d, and then the cobs were dissected. Subsequent steps to recover E04 were the same as in Method 1.3. Results3.1. Results from Method 1: Testing the Ability of a Microbe to Be Taken up from the Environment, Colonize Silks, and Subsequently Migrate Toward OvulesPantoeastrain E04 was inoculated onto the cut/uncut emerged silks of intact, husk-covered maize ears that had been placed either vertically or horizontally in jars (Figure 1). After inoculation and incubation, red fluorescent colonies were cultured from all three cobs that had been vertical and had silks that were left uncut; in 2/3 replicates, E04 was successfully cultured from silks near the base of the cobs (Figure 2). One cob from each of the remaining treatment combinations (vertical cut, horizontal cut, and horizontal uncut) had one or more red fluorescent colonies cultured from a single segment of silks (Figure 2). Additional non-fluorescent colonies were cultured (Figure 2), likely members of the diverse silk microbiome [6,8]. These results suggest that E04 can colonize silks when introduced from the environment and can migrate toward the ovule, but this is most consistent when cobs are uncut and in a vertical orientation.Microbe studies have a need for containment, and there are restrictions on the use of fluorescently tagged transgenic microbes. An advance of this study was the use of large (~3.8 L) glass jars to contain the large maize cobs treated with transgenic microbes (e.g.,Figure 1E).3.2. Results from Method 2: Testing the Competency of a Microbe to Colonize Silks from the Environment (Silk Tips) Versus Maternal Parent (Cob Base)Pantoeastrain E04 was inoculated onto vertical cobs, on the uncut silk tips, and in parallel onto the cob base (Figure 3). Fluorescent red colonies were cultured from all three replicate cobs that had been inoculated at silk tips (Figure 3D, left side), and E04 colonized all of the way down the silks to the silk tissue at the base in replicate 2. No red fluorescent colonies were isolated from samples that had been inoculated at the base of the cobs (Figure 3D, right side). Combined with the results ofFigure 2, these results suggest that strain E04 colonizes silks from the environment via exposed silk tips.4. DiscussionHere, two novel methods were successfully developed and tested with the objective of creating biologically relevant assays that could track the bacterial migration on cobs and silks, which may help determine the origin of the large numbers of silk-associated bacteria in maize [4,6,7] and whether they are attracted to ovules and hence vertically transmitted to progeny. Intact, growing cobs with attached husk leaves were successfully used to mimic the native habitat of silk-associated microbes. As maize cobs are large and microbial studies have a need for containment, particularly for transgenic microbes such as those that are fluorescently tagged, an advance of this study was the successful use of large glass jars to incubate cobs and their silks. A diverse and abundant microbiome is known to exist in maize silks [6,8], including many strains with resistance to multiple antimicrobials [8], so it was expected that some colonies without the Tet-resistant fluorescent plasmid would appear on the Tet-LB plates. The use of the fluorescent tag with UV light made it possible to distinguish colonies of E04. On a cautionary note, a limitation of this study was that, although replicated, each method was only validated in a single trial. However, the general biological findings from Method 1 were similar to those from Method 2; these experiments were conducted weeks apart and completely independent, and support the robustness of the findings as well as both approaches.4.1. Directional Colonization of Maize Silks by Pantoea Strain E04The methods presented for testing the directional colonization of silks in intact maize cobs were successful in determining thatPantoeastrain E04 can enter silks when applied to the exposed silk tips of a vertical cob in a jar but not when applied at the cob base (Figure 3). This result suggests that this microbe, which was cultured from open-pollinated maize silks, may have possibly originated from maize pollen or the environment, although further experiments would be required to confirm this hypothesis, including whether E04 inhabits maize pollen. ManyPantoeastrains are known to be beneficial to plants [23,24,25,26,27,28,29], and some are likely vertically transmitted [12,30]. The results here, combined with the previous gene-mining and in vitro study [4], suggest that E04 may hold potential as a multi-functional microbial treatment that could be sprayed onto exposed silks in season.As to the reason that E04 was unable to colonize silks via the cob base, the base was essentially a wound site where the cob had been snapped off from the stalk. Though this should have created an entry point for E04 into the cob, on a cautionary note, the wounded end may have acted differently than an intact connection point between a cob and the main stalk of maize. Perhaps the plant defenses in response to the wounding [31,32,33] prevented bacterial colonization from the base. In this regard, the cob base inoculation assay should be viewed cautiously until bacteria have been found that can successfully colonize silks from a severed cob base. Cob base-entering microbes would also be challenged by the obstacles on the path to reach the silks, including the cob itself and the ovule, which originates silks [2] and which, presumably, by the fertilization stage would have defenses against microbes [34].4.2. The Validity of Bacterial Inoculation of Silk Tips Attached to Intact Maize Cobs In VitroThe results from Method 2 showing directional colonization from the exposed silk tips (Figure 3) validated Method 1 (Figure 1andFigure 2) and, more specifically, the reliability of inoculating silk tips of intact cobs in vitro. This is because the application of DsRed-tagged E04 to silk tips in Method 1 allowed some E04 liquid culture to drip down to the base of the cobs in the vertical orientation and pool at the bottom of the Falcon tubes. This left the results unclear as to whether the E04 colonies that were cultured from these silks had entered the enclosed silks via the exposed silk tips or traveled upward through the vasculature of the cob from the base. Since in Method 2, all the deliberately base-fed cobs (Figure 3) were free from E04 in the silks, and all of the silk tip fed cobs contained E04 in the silks, it can be assumed that all of the E04 cultured from silks in the first experiment (Method 1) entered the enclosed silks via the exposed silk tips.4.3. The Effect of Cob Orientation on Bacterial ColonizationThe assay was successful in determining the conditions in which bacterial isolate E04 would colonize maize silks on intact, detached cobs. The combination of uncut silks and a vertical cob orientation resulted in the greatest silk colonization (Figure 1andFigure 2). As to the underlying reason for greater colonization on these silks within vertical cobs, the vertical orientation mimics the position of cobs on a stalk in modern maize hybrids that are adapted to a high field density [35], and it is possible that gravity contributes to the rapid downward colonization of the silks [36]. In pathogenicP. ananatis, flagella aid the bacteria in attaching to and spreading across the plant surfaces [37]; perhaps gravity aids the efficacy of flagella-based motility.4.4. The Effect of Cutting Silks on Bacterial ColonizationThe cut silks were observed to have grown out beyond the ends of the husk during the incubation period, indicating that this in planta assay employing young cobs utilizes living tissues, making it a contained, resource-efficient model for testing colonization of metabolically-active silks (Figure 1C). The uncut silks were more readily colonized than cut silks, perhaps due to a host wound response preventing entry of E04 and possibly related to the migration of silk cell nuclei to wound sites [21,38]. This is especially relevant in conjunction with maize breeding in general, and specifically microbiome-associated breeding, because controlled crosses are often performed by cutting the exposed silks before deliberate pollination [39]. These cuts could potentially reduce the transmission of microbes inherited via pollen, altering the seed microbiome of the progeny, and this warrants further research. It was interesting that here, E04 typically did not colonize far into silks that had been cut, whereas previous work observed E04 colonizing the inside of short segments of silks via wound sites [8,21]. Perhaps internal colonization via wound sites occurs across short distances, and further transit along the length of a silk is more challenging.5. LimitationsThe methods presented here represent an in planta assay that makes testing of novel bacteria possible in a way that keeps the bacteria with unknown human and environmental health impacts and the fluorescent plasmids contained to protect researchers and the environment. A trade-off, in terms of comparing these methods to whole-plant experiments, is that they do not exactly replicate field conditions; the cobs are detached from the maize stalk, and they are expected to have fewer long-term endogenous plant defenses with these methods [40], potentially allowing for more colonization. In terms of the cob base assay, the wounded tissue and some plant defenses at this location [31,32,33] may have also worked against upward colonization of the silks from the base. Furthermore, in this study, the microbes did not face the variable weather conditions as they would in the field. However, these limitations were essential to maintain sealed, contained conditions at a reasonable scale of size in a laboratory.6. Conclusions and Future ApplicationsThis study presented two novel, biologically relevant methods to track bacterial migration on maize silks from intact cobs to help determine the origin and fate of specific bacteria. A case study was presented for the model bacterial isolate E04 (Pantoea), which colonized silks when applied to the exposed, uncut tips on vertical cobs.Microbial treatments are increasingly important tools in sustainable agriculture. The methods developed here hold potential for assessing the ability of novel bacterial isolates to colonize silk tissues, which is critical for future studies, including vertical transmission of the floral microbiome, biocontrol against silk-invading pathogens [5], and biostimulants to promote plant reproduction [4]. These methods may be used as a screen prior to investing in greenhouse or field trials. If a strain of bacteria cannot colonize the silks well in a jar experiment, it may be precluded from further experiments. The methods demonstrated the ability of E04 to colonize silks when applied externally, which indicates that this isolate has the potential to colonize silks successfully if it were to be applied as an in-field microbial treatment.These methods may also be used in the study of microbial consortia [41,42], and different microbial strains could be tagged with different fluorescent tags (e.g., a bacterium with DsRed, another microbe with GFP, and another microbe with Turquoise). Interactions between members of the microbiome could be observed via confocal microscopy.These methods should also be utilized in conjunction with plant disease studies; there is much potential for research in this area, and a small, biologically relevant, contained system lends itself well to the study of silk\u2013microbe\u2013pathogen interactions since several fungal pathogens are known to invade seeds through the silk channel [5].Author ContributionsConceptualization, M.E.H.T.; methodology, M.E.H.T.; formal analysis, M.E.H.T.; investigation, M.E.H.T.; data curation, M.E.H.T.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.E.H.T.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.E.H.T. and M.N.R.; visualization, M.E.H.T.; supervision, M.N.R.; project administration, M.N.R.; funding acquisition, M.N.R.; M.E.H.T. conceived of the study, performed all experiments, analyzed all data, and wrote the manuscript; M.N.R. supervised the study and edited the manuscript.

        "abstract": "According to the World Health Organization (WHO), tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant global health challenge, with approximately 10 million new cases and 1.4 million deaths reported in 2020. TB disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries, where factors such as migrant population, malnutrition, type 2 diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection, and COVID-19 exacerbate its impact. TB also leads to substantial economic losses due to decreased productivity and high healthcare costs. Despite advances in treatments, TB remains a major public health issue, particularly in poorer regions. In Mexico, TB is considered a moderate-incidence disease, with higher prevalence in border states, mainly due to population displacements. Effective TB control requires collaboration between Mexico and the United States of America given the high cross-border human movement, like in the Baja California State that reported predominantly pulmonary TB cases. Effective management of TB involves rapid diagnosis and identification of antibiotic resistance. Techniques such as PCR, high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), and/or Xpert MTB/RIF have enhanced diagnostic accuracy. Future perspectives about TB management focus on developing new drugs and vaccines to combat drug-resistant strains, and the comorbidities associated, which must be addressed to reinforce of health public programs.",

        "content": "1. IntroductionThe World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) global tuberculosis (TB) report estimated that there were approximately 10 million new cases of TB worldwide in 2022. TB caused an estimated 1.30 million deaths (deaths from TB among people with HIV included) [1]. TB is particularly prevalent in low- and middle-income countries, where socio-economic conditions, malnutrition, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) co-infection and other infectious diseases such as COVID-19 are significant risk factors [2]. TB is caused by the bacillusMycobacterium tuberculosis, which is spread when sick people with TB expel bacteria into the air (e.g., by coughing). TB is estimated to cause billions of dollars in annual economic losses due to decreased productivity of those with the pathology and costs associated with its diagnosis and treatment. Additionally, TB has a global public health impact owing to the emergence of drug-resistant strains that complicates treatment and increases morbidity and mortality associated with the disease. To effectively tackle the impact of TB on global health, it is imperative to strengthen health systems, improve access to diagnosis and treatment of quality, promote preventive interventions such as vaccination [3] and increase investment in research for the development of novel antituberculosis drugs. Although advances have been made in the diagnosis and treatment of the disease, it remains a global public health problem, especially in the poorest regions [4].Mexico is considered a moderate-incidence country for TB. However, certain states, particularly those along the border with the United States of America (U.S.), have higher TB rates. This increased incidence is mostly attributed to the migration between Mexico and the U.S., contributing to the global spread of the disease [5]. Comorbidities also exacerbate the risk and aggravation of TB infections in Baja California (border state between Mexico and the U.S.). These main factors include (i) deficit nourishment or malnutrition, and also excess nourishment, metabolic syndrome and type 2 Diabetes (T2DM), with trends of T2DM-TB among hospitalized TB patients increasing significantly over recent years, likely due to the rise in T2DM cases [6]; (ii) human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), where a higher prevalence of HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and addictions or alcohol use are also associated with increased TB incidence [2]; and (iii) migratory phenomena, as migrants are at higher risk of communicable diseases, traumatic events, and inadequate healthcare [5]. Other variables are also discussed further below.Mexico reports over 19,000 cases and nearly 2000 deaths annually from tuberculosis in all forms, with more than 80% of cases and deaths being pulmonary. Baja California has the highest morbidity and mortality rates from tuberculosis in the country, and the incidence of cases has been increasing each year, indicating that the transmission chain of the disease has not been controlled. In the last five years, the morbidity rate for pulmonary tuberculosis increased from 46.5 in 2017 to 48.9 per 100,000 inhabitants in 2021, with a peak rate of 63.0 in 2019 [7].This work examines the status of TB, highlighting the comorbidities and the challenges faced by public health programs in this region of Mexico.1.2. General Mechanisms and Immune Evasion of Tuberculosis (TB)Tuberculosis (TB) is transmitted from person to person through the air when an infected individual coughs, sneezes, or talks, releasing TB bacteria in the form of tiny droplets known as aerosols. It is not, however, transmitted through casual contact, such as shaking hands or sharing food. However, individuals with a weakened immune system, or inflammatory low-grade chronic diseases such as obesity and other metabolic pathologies with prolonged and close exposure to someone with active TB are at higher risk of contracting the disease [8]. Nowadays, several genetic polymorphisms related to the host susceptibility for contracting the infection are described in human leukocyte antigens, Toll-like receptors, and even other micronutrient status-related factors such as vitamin D receptors [9,10].Overcrowded conditions, such as those found in prisons or shelters, can increase the risk of disease transmission and infection. This latter implies a mechanistic path that begins when a disruption of the innate axis leads to the arrival of the inhaled bacteria to the lungs and the epithelial cells perceive their presence through pattern recognition receptors for consequently unclenching antimicrobial changes in the surface liquid or even by releasing inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 or TNF-\u03b1 [11]. If the ratio of other cells as macrophages is enough to fight the bacterial challenge, macrophages can start the immune intervention. However, some bacteria can slowly replicate inside macrophages instead of being eliminated. In fact, following the life cycle of the bacteria, they rest inside the phagosome during the latent infection, leading to the formation of granulomas, inflammatory structures containing bacteria that function by limiting their spread [12,13].Bacteria can remain latent in granulomas for years until the immune system weakens and the disease becomes active. The symptoms of this condition can vary depending on the form of the disease. In cases of pulmonary TB, the most common symptoms include persistent cough for more than two weeks, chest pain, weakness, weight loss, fever, night sweats, and fatigue. However, it is important to note that some patients may have a latent form of the disease, meaning that they do not exhibit visible symptoms but may develop active disease in the future. In addition to clinical symptoms, laboratory tests such as the tuberculin skin test and imaging diagnostic tests can help to confirm the diagnosis of TB. In fact, many factors can induce compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or receiving immunosuppressive treatments, to be at a higher risk of developing the disease. These include nutrient depletion, smoking history, antioxidant changes and several other epigenetic or genetic individual factors [14]. Moreover, unfavorable socio-economic conditions, such as poverty, overcrowding, and malnutrition, also increase TB susceptibility.Furthermore,M. tuberculosisexpresses several factors that block the macrophage efforts in suppressing the pathogen. Among these, strategies such as the inhibition of intracellular trafficking and autophagy, the acquisition of cytosol access, induction of eukaryotic cell death or even the neutralization of components such as reactive species can be further analyzed [13,15].2. The Current Situation Regarding Tuberculosis Infections and Their Related Comorbidities in Baja California2.1. MigrationThe migration phenomenon at the Mexican border with the U.S. is another reason why this population is vulnerable to infections like TB. The fact that the states of California on the U.S. side and of Baja California on the Mexican side have the highest incidence rates, coincides with high concentrations of migrants, located in both states. The disease cannot be controlled successfully by either one or the other countries. Considering that there are approximately 400 million human crossings by land registered along this border each year. It is noteworthy that certain states located on the border between Mexico and the U.S. have an increased TB rate. In terms of number of infections rate, in 2023, Veracruz, Baja California, Guerrero, Tamaulipas, and Sonora ranked highest TB cases. In 2023, 2668 TB cases were diagnosed in Baja California, of which 2078 were pulmonary presentations (77.88%). Most cases occurred in the population aged between 25 and 49 years, with a ratio of 2 to 1 for men and women. 98% of diagnosed patients-initiated treatment, which is free and available at health facilities [16]. By 2024, the states of Baja California (9.5%, 681 cases), Chiapas (7.4%, 536 cases), Nuevo Le\u00f3n (8.4%, 605 cases), and Veracruz (9.9%, 712 cases) lead in the highest accumulated cases of respiratory TB, contributing to a total of 7,203 cases in Mexico [17]. Despite this, only 14.8% of TB deaths were among the uninsured, and bacteriological or histological methods failed to confirm TB deaths in 61.5% of registered cases. Delayed diagnosis and treatment of TB can increase mortality risk. Some states mentioned above belong to southern Mexico; however, the strains reported in these places could spread to the border regions due to the phenomenon of migration. For example, The Haarlem and LAM lineages ofM. tuberculosiswere the most common in southern Mexican population [18], and were the most frequently detected in Baja California, whereas, only a subset of isolates (12%) seemed to be autochthonous of BC [19], this without considering the possible dissemination of anotherM. tuberculosisstrains from Central and South America, where incident rates of tuberculosis increased [20,21]. In the specific case of Mexico, migration to the U.S. has faced unique challenges. Over the past decade, 394,482 individuals have undergone medical examinations as part of their legal migration process to the U.S. Out of those, 8775 (2.2%) were suspected of having TB, and 157 (1.8%) were confirmed to have TB. TB symptoms and/or evident recent close contact with TB-infected individuals, or in subjects whose chest X-ray shows suggestive TB images. In other words, the pathology is diagnosed through positive cultures or via clinical-epidemiological elements supporting it. The relative risk among migrants (with a 2.9 average for the period) reflected that this group has nearly three times the likelihood of acquiring TB compared to the population without this condition. This also indicates that healthcare personnel in contact with this population group have the same risk of contracting this condition [22]. Financial barriers make it difficult for uninsured individuals to access healthcare services, such as diagnostic tests, medications, and hospitalization. If health insurance is not available, medical care may be delayed, leading to more severe disease progression and poorer outcomes [8]. Consequently, it is imperative to cover and enhance diagnostic methods and treatments.2.2. Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is an agent that has caused a serious public health problem since it was identified in 1981. With a fast and aggressive replication starting in the first stages of the pathology, it causes the destruction of the immune system and becomes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in the most advanced stage of the disease [23]. As HIV targets the different leukocyte populations, it weakens the immunological system, increasing the probability of presenting normally harmless community acquired infections and other diseases like TB and several kinds of cancer [23,24]. Furthermore, these changes in the immunological system can also be increased by risk factors such as a higher body mass index, high levels of HbA1c, insulin resistance, hypertension or high serum lipidic levels [25], which imply a chronic systemic low-grade inflammatory status with or without obesity [26].It is also remarkable that for pharmaceutical control of HIV, antiretroviral therapy (ART), a combination of molecules that can decrease the viral multiplication, must be used, reducing the viral load and thus the viral activity in the host and the possibility of its transmission. Nevertheless, these substances have also been related with adverse metabolic effects (especially when used in a long-term administration) that include immune activation, chronic inflammation, adipose tissue dysfunction, modifications in insulin\u2013glucose homoeostasis, and even lipidic and cardiovascular changes [27,28].By 2021, it was reported that nearly 38.4 million people lived with HIV around the world, with 2.1 million in Latin America, 340,000 in Mexico, and over 40,000 in Mexico City [29,30]. In Mexico, the states of Veracruz (13%), Mexico City (9.5%), Jalisco (8%), the State of Mexico (6.9%), and Baja California (6.8%) have the highest rates of HIV-related deaths [31]. This highlights the importance of the control of this pathology when analyzing TB implications in this vulnerable population.2.3. DiabetesIn Baja California, Mexico, the prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in the population aged 20 years and over is 10% according to data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (ENSANUT) 2018. Furthermore, 86.9% of adults with a previous medical diagnosis of diabetes in the country use some form of pharmacological treatment, with oral hypoglycemic agents being the most common (67.1%) [32]. Although TB susceptibility is typically associated with underweight individuals, low-grade chronic inflammation due to obesity and related metabolic comorbidities [33], particularly T2DM, has been shown to triple the risk of infection and exacerbate its severity [34]. More importantly, the metabolic pathology increases the treatment failure rate and the susceptibility of infection with a resistant strain [35]. Worse immunological markers have been associated with this stage, with dysregulated cytokine responses and relations between 1 and 2 profile cytokines, impaired pathogen recognition, decreased phagocytosis, and cellular activation [36]. Other epigenetic modulators in these patients and other pathogenic strategies including the dormancy adaption via two-component systems, redox-potentiated proteins, and other strategies to dampen the oxidative damage may also increase immune evasion bacterial mechanisms and can further impact the establishment of the infection. Lifestyle is thus a determining factor for control and normal immunological outcomes, which include granuloma formation and the non-infective cycle ofM. tuberculosis.A low body mass index is an established risk factor for active TB. Recent evidence suggests that TB is linked to an acute or chronic decrease in body weight [33]. In fact, being underweight increases vulnerability to TB through mechanisms related to compromised immune and thymic function. Low plasma leptin levels are associated with this condition, which is the opposite to the high leptin concentration that occurs in obesity because of the increment in fat mass. Leptin promotes proliferation and activation of T lymphocytes upon mitogen stimulation, thus, despite the proinflammatory role of this molecule, it can serve as a protective factor against infections [33]. Nutritional factors and the related obesity and adiposity can influence the activity of the immune system to combat TB and other infections. The role of cytokine-mediated innate immunity in host protection against TB infection has been demonstrated in numerous experimental models of infection and established critical roles for interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukins (IL) in controlling infection [33]. In obesity, there is an over-expression of TNF-\u03b1, which attracts M1-polarized macrophages, thereby increasing the levels of inflammatory mediators such as C-reactive protein, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b3.In the case of obesity associated with diabetes, no mediated effect on TB has been observed. The protective effect of a high body mass index (BMI) seems to be stronger than the increased risk due to diabetes itself [37]. In this sense, T2DM also results in an increase in neutrophils and monocyte-secreted cytokines, including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-8. In addition, there is an impairment in infection by the induction of cytokine production and a reduction in phagocytic and antibacterial activity. T2DM decreases the level of regulatory T cells (Tregs) while increasing Th17 populations, promoting an exaggerated inflammatory response [38]. Thus, T2DM could be considered as a risk factor for developing TB, which has to be considered in the search for new prophylactic strategies [38]. Additionally, T2DM is associated with the development of drug-resistant TB, which contributes to maintaining the TB condition as a serious health concern [39]. T2DM increases the risk of developing TB by 3.1-fold, and the association with TB has been recognized as a risk factor for unfavorable treatment outcomes, increasing the probability of failure, relapse, or death. Comorbidities have a 4.7-fold greater risk of becoming single-drug resistant, and a 2.8- to 3.5-fold increased risk of becoming multidrug resistant (DR-TB), promoting the elongation of the infection and proliferation of the microorganism, which has been partially explained by the decreased plasma concentrations of anti-TB drugs, interference by drugs used for glycemic control, and immunological alterations. Chronic hyperglycemia due to poorly controlled diabetes may promote the accumulation of advanced glycation products (AGEs) and receptors for AGEs (RAGEs), mainly expressed in the lungs, the primary site of TB infection. Activation of RAGEs leads to increased inflammation due to the production of reactive oxygen species and proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL17, resulting in defective phagocytosis, coupled with an increase in oxidative stress and changes in the distribution of anti-TB drugs, which are factors that could modify the mutation rates of the increasing risk of developing drug- and multidrug-resistant TB. Particularly,katGS325T mutation has been associated with isoniazid resistance at an early stage of the infection [39].Other authors like Lin, Wu, Wang, Fu, L\u00f6nnroth, Chang and Huang [37] have reported that individuals who were simultaneously obese/overweight and diabetic had a similar or even lower risk of TB than non-diabetic individuals with normal weight. In addition, metabolic syndrome intensifies with an increase in adiposity, thereby raising the level of immune protection against TB, which at the same time is counterbalanced by the deleterious effects of dysglycemia [38]. Arias, Goig, Cardona, Torres-Puente, D\u00edaz, Rosales, Garcia, Tapia, Comas, Vilaplana and Cardona [38] showed that a high-fat diet can trigger a pro-inflammatory response, resulting in a faster progression toward active TB and an impaired protective effect of Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin vaccination, which is not the case for natural immunity. The authors suggested that there is a dysbiosis in gut microbiota either in obesity or TB. As T2DM is a risk factor for developing TB, these findings may prove useful in the search for new prophylactic strategies for this population subset. Curiously, a recent study in a human cohort has shown an increase in gut microbiota diversity in TB patients. This is an interesting finding given that the BMI of TB patients was significantly lower than for healthy controls [40].The analysis of the disease and variables is indeed very important. InTable 1, some additional comments of the regional situation in Baja California considering other factors linked with tuberculosis are made.3. Detecting and Implementing Analytical Tools Early Are Crucial for Managing Tuberculosis in the Migratory Region3.1. New Analytical ToolsThe introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) molecular tests has been a significant advancement in TB diagnosis. These tests have high sensitivity and specificity for detecting bacterial DNA in clinical samples. Additionally, rapid diagnostic tests, such as the tuberculin skin test and tests for the detection of specificM. tuberculosisantigens, provide results quickly, allowing for accurate and timely diagnosis and early treatment initiation. In the field of treatment, advances include the development of standard treatment regimens that combine effective and well-tolerated antitubercular drugs. These regimens have cure rates exceeding 90% in cases of drug-sensitive TB [52].However, drug resistance, especially to rifampicin, has raised concerns. To address this, new treatment regimens have been developed that include second-line medications such as bedaquiline and delamanid, which have been effective against drug-resistant strains ofM. tuberculosis. In recent years, there has been concern about the increasing drug resistance, especially resistance to rifampicin. To address this challenge, new treatment regimens for drug-resistant TB have been developed and recommended. These regimens include the administration of second-line medications, such as bedaquiline and delamanid, which have been shown to be effective against drug-resistant strains ofM. tuberculosis. According to a study by Piubello et al. [53], the use of these medications in combination with other drugs has led to cure rates exceeding 50% in cases of multidrug-resistant TB.TB diagnosis by PCR allows for the detection of the bacterial DNA in clinical samples, such as sputum or blood, with high sensitivity and specificity. A recent study conducted by Xu et al. [54] demonstrated that PCR has a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 98% compared to traditional diagnostic methods. According to a study, the antigen detection test has a sensitivity of 92% and a specificity of 98%. Advanced imaging techniques, such as high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), have been developed to aid in the diagnosis of pulmonary TB. HRCT allows the visualization of characteristic TB lesions, such as nodules, cavities, and lymphadenopathy, with greater clarity and precision. Other molecular diagnostic techniques based on the detection and analysis of the genetic material of the microorganism to specifically identify it, are genotypic. These include NAAT (nucleic acid amplification tests), which amplify specific sequences of the genetic material of M. tuberculosis by PCR in clinical samples such as sputum, pleural or ganglia fluid [55]. As they are highly sensitive and specific, they can quickly and precisely help to diagnose TB. Other genotypic tests are fast and can even detect some antibiotic-resistant strains. In this group, INNO-LiPA MYCOBACTERIA and GenoType MTBC are included based on their ability to test for specific DNA sequences such as IS6110, 16S, mce-3, RD, and mtp-40 [56,57,58].Several new techniques to determine the presence of the bacteria have also been developed for the diagnosis of the pathology, such as new biomarkers including urinary lipoarabinomannan [59], novel biosensors such as the peptide nuclide acid electrochemical biosensor based on reduced graphene oxide (NH2-rGO)/2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl) oxyl nanocrystalline cellulose (TEMPO-NCC) [60], an electrochemical genosensor assembled to detect Mtb in lyophilized powder [61], an optical biosensor based on the FRET method, also known as a universal fluorescent biosensor for the bacterial detection of the insertion sequenceIS6110gene fragment [62], a green graphene nanofiber laser biosensor (LSG-NF) with oil palm lignin-based synthetic silver nanoparticles [63] and even a MR-biosensor [64] with high potential for TB diagnosis. All future research and applications on the procedures for the extraction, isolation and assessment of clinical samples will allow the use and adaptation of new technologies in a real clinical problem.In Mexico, TB diagnosis is validated by the National Tuberculosis Program from the Special System of the Epidemiological Vigilance of Tuberculosis and the National Network of public health laboratories for the TB vigilance (RNLSP-tb). Bacilloscopy is established as the most important technique in TB research; and in special cases, other confirmatory methods can also be included. The challenge remains the diagnosis and identification of the antibiotic resistances as soon as possible. For this purpose, phenotypic, genotypic and whole-genome sequencing methods have been developed. The first ones include Bacilloscopy, a fast diagnosis method in which the observation of the sputum under microscope can detect the presence of the acid\u2013alcohol-resistant bacillus, characteristics of M. tuberculosis. Other less specific ways of assessment include optical microscopy, which can be improved by using fluorescent and LED microscopy to increase the visibility of the presence of the bacillus, thus increasing the sensitivity of the diagnosis. L\u00f6wenstein\u2013Jensen, Stonebrink & Middlebrook 7H10 and 7H11 and the liquid medium BACTEC are methods used in liquid and solid cultures to promote the growth of M. tuberculosis from clinical samples, confirming its presence in patients. Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time-Of-Flight (MALDI-TOF) is also used for the rapid and precise identification of the microorganisms, implying the ionization of their molecules and the measurement of its molecular mass to compare with a database for the identification of the bacteria [65]. The three main selected techniques, PCR, traditional Bacilloscopy and cultures, as long as genotypic tests, are the most practical and widely applied diagnostic tools in Baja California due to their proven effectiveness and availability. PCR is valued for its high sensitivity and specificity, allowing precise and rapid detection of bacterial DNA (Table 2). Traditional Bacilloscopy and cultures remain fundamental methods because they confirm the presence of M. tuberculosis through direct observation and bacterial growth. Genotypic tests are essential for identifying antibiotic-resistant strains, enabling more targeted and effective treatment. These methods form the foundation of TB diagnosis and treatment in the region, though continuous improvement in infrastructure and access to advanced technologies is necessary.3.2. Management of the Tuberculosis Program in MexicoSeveral governments have acquired policies by which they subsidize at least some of the molecules of the first line of the treatment. Nevertheless, as for other diseases, the therapies are usually long, expensive, and inaccessible for a large proportion of the patients. To evaluate the bacterial pharmacological treatment resistance, several methods currently used, such as Xpert\u00aeMTB/RIF, INNO-LIPA Rif TB kit, GenoType MTDRplus and GenoType MTBDRsl [66]. The sequencing process which can also determine the whole order of the nitrogen bases of the microorganism. The current platforms for this analysis include Roche454, MiSeq Illumina, PacBio and IonTorrent and have lately revolutionized our capacity for studying genetics and their applications for microbiology research [67,68].The treatment of TB has evolved considerably in recent decades, thanks to the advancements in research and the development of new medications. Modern treatments for TB focus on administering a combination of effective and well-tolerated antitubercular drugs, with the goal of achieving cure and preventing drug resistance. The standard treatment regimen for drug-sensitive TB includes the administration of four first-line medications: isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. These medications are given daily during an initial intensive phase, followed by a maintenance phase lasting several months. According to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines, this treatment has a cure rate of over 90% in cases of drug-sensitive TB. Furthermore, short-course therapies have been developed for the treatment of drug-sensitive TB. For example, the treatment regimen with rifapentine and isoniazid administered once a week for three months has been shown to be as effective as the standard six-month regimen. According to a clinical trial conducted by Njie et al. [69], this short-course treatment regimen has a cure rate of 90% in cases of drug-sensitive TB. Additionally, short-course therapies, such as the rifapentine and isoniazid treatment regimen administered once weekly for three months, have been shown to be as effective as standard six-month regimens. Drug-resistant TB cases and deaths have risen, highlighting the need for new treatments. Current DR-TB treatments have issues like long duration, significant side effects, and drug resistance. Alpibectir (BVL-GSK098) is a promising new drug targeting mycobacterial transcription regulators, enhancing the bioactivation of ethionamide (Eto), reducing the required dose, and minimizing side effects. Alpibectir has shown high solubility, good bioavailability, and a favorable safety profile in preclinical studies. A first-in-human study is underway to assess its safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics [70,71]. Bacteriological diagnosis of TB in Mexico relies on the laboratories of the \u201cRed Nacional de Laboratorios de Salud P\u00fablica para la Vigilancia de la Tuberculosis,\u201d which has different administrative levels and diagnostic capabilities. This network ensures that diagnostic techniques are uniform and follow the guidelines for tuberculosis surveillance. As said before, the Baja California state is located at the border of the United States of America and presents high incidence of TB [72] and the government subsidizes first-line treatment. In cases of resistance, second-line therapies are administered, which are not funded by the government, making adherence to treatment very difficult for low-income patients. There are also alternatives for some patients to be part of the binational project \u201cPrograma Binacional de Tuberculosis Esperanza y Amistad\u201d and the \u201cComisi\u00f3n de Salud Fronteriza M\u00e9xico\u2014Estados Unidos,\u201d which subsidize the second-line treatment.Furthermore, most private primary care clinics consider the implementation of TB screening in T2DM patients acceptable and practicable. In fact, a great number of diabetic patients enthusiastically accept TB\u2013T2DM screening services. T2DM prevalence was 10.6% in 2020, and as mentioned before, previous studies have identified factors associated with TB\u2013T2DM duality in rural populations of Mexico, where factors such as low income or insufficient income for basic needs, obesity and migration (central American migrants aiming to reach the U.S.) contribute to the problem [73]. The increasing link between this pathology and diabetes, higher incidence, mortality rates, and the need for tailored interventions are specific challenges faced in the region [74]. In addition, healthcare professionals in clinics or hospitals are aware of the nature of the intervention and demonstrate a positive attitude to combating this burden. The stigma associated with other infectious diseases like COVID-19 has emerged as new implementation barriers, joining TB stigma, lack of resources, and regulatory issues. Gradual and analytical screening is a potential method for enhancing the implementation of TB-DM screening [75]. The importance of national and binational programs needs to be emphasized and encouraged by governments and health authorities along with the internal sector links to consolidate strategies for combating TB, especially along the northern border of Mexico, due to the T2DM and migration phenomena.Table 3recapitulates the recommendations of the WHO [76] and contrasts it with Mexican TB management practices.4. ConclusionsDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, there was an increase in tuberculosis cases and deaths, as well as its transmission. This was partially due to a decrease in the notification of tuberculosis cases in all forms during the pandemic but not yet of its existence. In fact, focus group discussions and interviews revealed that the primary causes of this were a reduction in tuberculosis case notifications and less interest in its surveillance, thus its transmission continued even without being well detected and/or treated. Other causes include the disruption of TB services and restrictions on patient movement, consequently increasing TB-related deaths. Also, a decrease in case-finding efforts of community health workers and outreach workers, delays in tuberculosis diagnosis, and limited access to tuberculosis supplies and services were found. As for other important pathologies for the population such as metabolic diseases like diabetes mellitus, hypertension or hyperlipemia, they were also found to be a second-level cause\u2014in fact, COVID-19 was the most important statistically and acutely affected several people.Particularly in border cities in Baja California, Mexico, such as Mexicali and Tijuana, the migrant population faces serious public health challenges, particularly concerning tuberculosis. The vulnerability of this population, often housed in shelters or wandering the city, contributes to frequent treatment abandonment, which exacerbates the transmission of the disease. This problem is further compounded by a poor nutritional and health status and treatment resistance, making the control of tuberculosis even more difficult. The lack of access to adequate diagnosis and treatment in a potentially overburdened and resource-limited health jurisdiction transforms this issue into a public health crisis that requires urgent and coordinated attention. It is crucial to reduce the costs of diagnostic techniques to detect resistant strains to first-line tuberculosis treatments, as this will enable early and accurate disease detection. The implementation of more affordable and accessible technologies will not only facilitate tuberculosis monitoring and control but also ensure that all individuals, regardless of their economic situation or geographic location, can access these vital diagnostics. In this way, the response to resistant tuberculosis can be significantly improved, reducing the spread of the disease, and improving global health outcomes.Author ContributionsConceptualization, G.N.H.-A. and E.T.-M., writing\u2014original draft preparation, G.N.H.-A., D.R.-P., R.G.-V. and E.T.-M., writing\u2014review and editing, G.N.H.-A., D.R.-P., R.G.-V. and E.T.-M.

        "abstract": "Oral health remains one of the most taken for granted parts of human body health, even though poor oral health has now been linked to various diseases, such as cancers, diabetes, autoimmune complications, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular disease, just to name a few. As we review in this paper, substance use or abuse, including alcohol, smoking, recreational drugs, and pharmaceutical drugs can have significant implications on oral health, which in turn can lead to more systemic diseases. In this paper, we show that oral microbiome dysbiosis and inflammatory cytokine pathways are two of the most significant mechanisms contributing to oral health complications from substance use. When substance use decreases beneficial oral species and increases periodontopathogenic strains, a subsequent cascade of oncogenic and inflammatory cytokines is triggered. In this review, we explore these mechanisms and others to determine the consequences of substance use on oral health. The findings are of significance clinically and in research fields as the substance-use-induced deterioration of oral health significantly reduces quality of life and daily functions. Overall, the studies in this review may provide valuable information for future personalized medicine and safer alternatives to legal and pharmaceutical substances. Furthermore, they can lead towards better rehabilitation or preventative initiatives and policies, as it is critical for healthcare and addiction aid specialists to have proper tools at their disposal.",

        "content": "1. IntroductionOral health and wellness is often greatly underestimated in connection to serious medical diseases, despite overwhelming evidence of oral associations with cardiovascular disease, pneumonia, osteoarthrosis, rheumatic disease, Crohn\u2019s disease, kidney and liver disease, metabolic syndromes, cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, autoimmune disorders, adverse pregnancy outcomes, and various other illnesses [1,2,3]. The compositional diversity and functional homeostasis of the microbiome found on teeth and gums can greatly contribute to that oral health and wellness, which thus impacts the above listed concomitant ailments. The second largest and most varied microbiome after the gut is the oral microbiome, which includes about 700 species of bacteria, fungi, viruses, and protozoa [4]. The relationship between oral health and ailments in other parts of the body seems to be related to the dysbiosis of the human oral microbiome, as well as systemic spread of the oral microbiome inhabitants [5]. Substance use or abuse can significantly influence this dysbiosis leading to subsequent health complications [6,7,8,9].The oral microbiome includes microbial colonization of saliva, oral mucosa, and teeth, with microbes that include protozoa, bacteria, viruses, and fungi [2]. In the oral cavity, bacteria can colonize two surfaces: the hard and soft tissues of the teeth, and the oral mucosa. Microorganisms can grow in the rich and ideal conditions provided by the teeth, tongue, cheeks, gingival sulcus, tonsils, hard palate, and soft palate [10].Streptococcus mutans(S. mutans) is a major bacterium responsible for hard tissue infections of the teeth, leading to dental caries, which are the most prevalent chronic infectious disease in the oral cavity. In comparison with healthy individuals, dental caries are characterized by the increased complexity of microbial enzymes and decreased diversity of oral microbiota on their surfaces, which is probably as a result of the acidic environment [11]. This imbalance happens because of the bacterial metabolization of the glycoproteins present in the saliva and gingival crevicular fluid. The production of weak acid by the bacteria leads to tooth erosion [10,11]. As the main source of acid production that leads to dental caries is bacterial metabolism, the risk of developing dental caries is significantly influenced by the systemic host response to bacterial infections. The tooth structure can also be weakened due to factors such as genetics, medication side effects, other diseases, or environmental toxin exposure. Therefore, the likelihood of developing dental caries is determined by the bacterial composition, diet, and the host\u2019s defense system [12].In addition to dental caries of the hard tooth enamel, 20\u201350% of the global population are diagnosed with periodontal disease, which affects the soft gum tissue surrounding the teeth [13]. An imbalance in bacterial homeostasis of the oral microbiome can lead to the development of periodontal disease which initiates a host inflammatory response, resulting in damage of the soft and connective-tooth tissues. Moreover, the accumulation of microbial plaque and its enzymes on the teeth and gingiva triggers the human body\u2019s defense response, which plays a significant role in the initiation of periodontal disease [14].It has now been shown that various substances, such as alcohol, recreational drugs, and pharmaceutical drugs, can all impact the intricate connections described above with regards to the oral microbiome and the subsequent development of caries and periodontal diseases. Overall, the impact of medications on oral health is not a new concept. Even in 2008, a study of 529 participants in Turkey demonstrated that participants in the medication group (including anticholesterol, antidiabetes, cardiovascular drugs, and various other prescriptions) resulted in significantly higher rates of oral dryness, gingival bleeding, and alveolar bone resorption, leading to more missing teeth and prosthetic needs [15]. In this review, which prioritized peer-reviewed articles published within the past 5 years, mechanisms by which substance use and abuse lead to the development of oral health complications will be explored, as well as the significance towards potential remediation and treatment of those ailments. By examining the impact of both legal and illegal substances on oral health, we aim to demonstrate ways to better develop preventative strategies to minimize oral diseases and determine effective strategies to most effectively treat the complications that arise from these substances.2. Dental Implications of Alcohol UseLiver damage tends to be the first thought when exploring the implications of alcohol use on the body. Areas other than the liver, however, including the oral microbiome, have now been seen to also suffer great disruption from alcohol use, which can lead to a cascade of complications connected to oral health [1]. 16s rRNA gene sequencing has helped demonstrate strong correlations of specific tongue genera in alcohol use disorder, with a noticeable change in oral genera observed upon abstinence [16]. This microbial dysbiosis appears to have significant impacts on human health.Alcohol consumption effects on the oral microbiome can have detrimental consequences through various pathways [17]. One mechanism observed is that the microbiome organisms produce alcohol dehydrogenase that then converts consumed alcohol into acetaldehyde, which is known to be carcinogenic [17]. Furthermore, alcohol intake hinders anti-oxidant pathways, such as glutathione (GSH), that protect against cancer consequences, and simultaneously increases detrimental chronic inflammation immune responses [17]. Thus alcohol abuse is not only associated with increased dental caries, but also with severe inflammation complications, such as necrotizing gingivitis, periodontitis, and stomatitis [18]. Ailments are further complicated and agitated by the various deficiencies and malnutrition that are also associated with alcohol abuse [18]. The host tends towards more severe medical outcomes in these situations due to the alcohol-induced damage to white blood cells, including neutrophils, macrophages, and T cells [18]. Alcohol use, and more importantly, abuse, also leads to consistent vomiting in many individuals, which then introduces gastric hydrochloric acid into the oral cavity, eroding dental tissues [19,20]. The highly acidic pH of many alcoholic beverages have also been found to contributes to the dental erosion, as well, which can then contribute to tooth fractures, pulpits, periodontitis, modification of the dimensions of bite, and temporomandibular joint damage [19,20]. It has been shown that damage in the oral cavity can also be further impacted by the significant environmental change that occurs when alcohol use leads to a dehydration cascade in which an antidiuretic hormone is secreted, salivary glands atrophy, and sialadenosis (gland inflammation) and xerostomia (dry mouth) are triggered [21,22].With the various environmental changes in the oral cavity reported above in alcohol users, it is no surprise that the microbial organisms residing in the cavity change in abundance as alcohol use increases. Patients with alcohol dependency in one study demonstrated a drop in abundance of various oral genera that are highly abundant in healthy individuals (Moryella,Selenomonas,Bulleidia, andCatonella) and an increase in periodontitis-associated genera (Filifactor,Lactobacillus, andDialister) [16]. Higher alcohol consumption has also been linked to oral enrichment of the generaActinomyces,Leptotrichia,Cardiobacterium, andNeisseria[23]. This is of interest to the dental and medical community, asNeisseriais amongst the microbes known to produce the aforementioned carcinogen acetaldehyde at high rates from alcohol [23]. The increase in periodontopathogenic bacteria in the presence of alcohol use includes a higher association when genetic polymorphisms are present, such asALDH2-deficient individuals.ALDH2-deficient individuals have a slower ethanol metabolism and thus these results demonstrate the impact of a more prolonged exposure to alcohol and alcohol metabolism [24]. The increased amount of periodontopathogenic bacteria was also associated with increased levels of salivary IL1\u03b2, which is a cytokine that increases inflammation and is linked to oncogenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma via a mechanism of increased proliferation of cells and stimulation of other oncogenic cytokines [24].Overall, not only is the increase in pathogenic or periodontic genera problematic, but a concurrent decrease in commensal normal flora is also observed, which then promotes further inflammation and detrimental consequences [23]. The decrease of commensal normal flora has even been shown to include microbes involved in the metabolic detoxification of the dangerous acetaldehyde into non-toxic or less toxic forms, which further leads to an accumulation of the acetaldehyde in alcoholics [23]. Alcohol type has also been shown to impact the consequences on the oral microbiome, with wine drinkers demonstrating a lower oral microbial alpha diversity and number of genera, whereas liquor and beer consumption were associated with increased alpha diversity and genera [16]. Wine drinking has been associated with a decrease inPeptococcus, beer drinking has been associated with decreasedPorphyromonas, and liquor drinking has been associated with decreasedLachnospiraceae[23]. Beer drinking also appears to be associated with an increase inPascardovia[23]. Differences in the impact observed with different alcohol types (such as beer versus liquor versus wine) can be attributed to various factors including the sugar content variations amongst types, as well as the difference in the percentage of alcohol actually present in each type of drink [16,23]. Additionally, the frequency of alcohol consumption also impacts the effects observed, as well as potential remediation [20]. When looking at data of dental caries and oral health, a higher frequency of drinking alcohol is associated with higher tooth wear in order of regular drinkers (42.5% drinkers with tooth wear), frequent drinkers (25%), occasional drinkers/non-drinkers (17.5%) (meaning a range of more than four days of drinking a week as regular drinkers down to zero days of drinks a week as non-drinkers) [22].In addition, it should be noted that synergistic effects appear to exist, such as an increase in missing teeth or dental caries in alcoholic tobacco smokers compared to alcohol-only users, but these connections need further experimentations [18,20,25]. It is believed that such connections are in part due to the observance of poorer oral hygiene in smokers or tobacco chewers, which further increases the number of caries and missing teeth [25]. Furthermore, smoking is known to have the same dehydrating effect mentioned already in regards to alcohol, which means smoking further enhances damaging inflammatory sialadenosis and xerostomia effects [21]. In one study, the difference in dental caries and tooth decay observed in alcohol-only users versus alcohol and drug use together was a 38% higher risk in the combined users [26]. Additionally, higher social status, white race, amount of alcohol consumed, and wine drinking all resulted in higher association with decay and number of fillings. It is explained that males of higher social status in the study drank wine and had great amounts of caries, whereas males of lower status tended to drink beer and thus has lower amounts of caries [26]. When individual layers of the plaque composition were analyzed, it was found that significant differences of both supragingival facultative aerobes and subgingival anaerobes exist in wine drinkers, with major decreases in microbial frequencies in both layers in wine users [27]. Interestingly, in that same study, it was also found that the same decrease was observed in coffee drinkers as well, which demonstrated that some of the decrease in the microbial oral composition of wine drinkers may be due in part to the polyphenol content contributing to an inhibition of adhesion or some other hindrance against microbes [27]. Polyphenols have been shown to block microbial adhesion via interactions with bacteria membrane proteins, and strongly inhibit bacterial glycosyltransferase and amylase, both of which participate in plaque adhesion [28,29,30].The implications of alcohol use on oral health are highly interconnected as seen inFigure 1. The promising aspect, though, of these various studies looking into the impact of alcohol on oral health and hygiene is that many of the observed consequences have potential for remediation. For instance, in one study, within even just the first week of an alcohol-use dependency inpatient treatment program, a significant net increase of healthy genera and decrease of periodontitis-associated genera was observed, which is promising for remediation potential [16]. Data demonstrating improvement of dysbiosis consequences upon abstinence from alcohol and improved oral hygiene is promising as it demonstrates the reversibility of some of the microbial based damages to health [16].3. Dental Implications of Recreational Drug Use (Other than Alcohol)Substance abuse is a growing public health issue and its interconnectedness with the oral cavity and the microbiome is becoming a main concern. The correlation specifically introduces the relationship between recreational drug users and their susceptibility to dental disease. Throughout the world, illegal substance abuse or recreational drug use has increased as a literature review from 2017 presents that illicit drugs affect around 27.8 million people in North America and will be more common in the coming years [31]. Common recreational drugs such as cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and cannabis have been widely recognized as contributors to the complications of dental hygiene [32]. Through a lack of hygienic habits when under the influence, increases in inflammatory cytokine pathways, a disruption of protective salivary fluids, and pH changes all modifying the composition and functional diversity of the oral microbiome, drug use can have significant impacts on oral health, including the development and progression of cancer [33,34].3.1. CannabisCannabis use has recently been on the rise, with recreational legalization occurring in 19 states as of August 2022, 49.6 million people reporting use in the past year, and 2.8 million initiating use during that period [35]. In the oral cavity, saliva stands as a key protection factor as it prevents the accumulation of harmful bacteria and aids in digestion [36]. Cannabis has been shown to significantly reduce the rate of salivary flow [37,38]. Saliva maintains oral hygiene by rinsing away microorganisms and enriching the environment in calcium and phosphate, allowing remineralization to occur and the hard tissues of the teeth to be protected [39,40].The oral microbiome is heavily associated with and altered by cannabis use as there are fluctuations of several different bacterial species. A study done to uncover the change in the oral flora of cannabis users included the results that Actinomyces and Streptococcus had grown in a cannabis-containing environment [41]. In chronic cannabis smokers, the Actinomyces genus was more present as compared to tobacco smokers and was linked to increased CNS dysfunction or abnormalities [41]. Both Streptococcus and Actinomyces are considered \u201cacid-tolerant\u201d, hence their survival in the acidity of the saliva produced by cannabis [41]. Their ability to store extra sugars as intracellular polysaccharides after overproduction gives the non-mutans an energy source to produce acids when sugar is low, decreasing the pH and further demineralizing the enamel [42]. Although there is an increased risk with forming caries, cannabis has been seen to have anti-inflammatory properties in rats as it can inhibit the expression ofRANK/RANKLthat can ultimately lead to slowed progression of periodontitis [43].RANKLis responsible for the balance between osteoblasts and osteoclasts, and the cannabinoids are linked to the decrease of production of inflammatory mediators [43]. Specifically, non-psychotropic CBD is responsible for this inhibition as the activation of CB2 receptors is seen to reduce osteoclastogenisis through the blockage ofRANKLexpression [43]. Therefore, cannabis can have both detrimental and advantageous aspects to the severity of dental disease.3.2. MethamphetamineMethamphetamine can be characterized as a powerful stimulant that increases physical activity by processing different neurotransmitters, including dopamine and serotonin [44,45]. In the ongoing drug abuse crisis, methamphetamine has become a dominant force, with its use increasing from 1.4 million people in 2016 to 2.0 million in 2019 in ages 12 or older within the United States [46]. This upward trend can be associated with the oral cavity as this pervasive substance abuse gives rise to certain conditions ultimately leading to increased cavity presence, usually on labial surfaces. Known as \u201cmeth mouth\u201d, the frequent and direct use of methamphetamine can cause teeth to become \u201cblackened\u201d and \u201crotting\u201d as the acidic nature of the drug can lead to conditions such as xerostomia [47]. Increased vulnerability to caries can be explained by meth\u2019s ability to eliminate the buffering capacity of saliva, or its potential to neutralize acids [32]. It is active for about 8\u201312 h on average but can be found in saliva for up to 24\u201328 h, therefore patients are unable to be treated after immediate use [48].The relative abundance of certain bacterial species can be attributed to methamphetamine use, where the taxa that are known to cause dysbiosis are heavily prominent. TheNeisseriagenus had exhibited higher levels amongst abusers, which coincided with IL-17 abundance in saliva [49].Neisseriaproduces extracellular polysaccharides and glycolytic sugars in the presence of sucrose, contributing to tooth decay as oral bacteria has the tendency to process sugars through the glycolytic pathways resulting in acids responsible for the degradation of enamel [49,50]. The increased presence of proinflammatory cytokine IL-17 is seen in patients suffering from periodontitis that induces the production ofRANKL, causing this inflammatory response and ultimate osteoclastogenesis [51]. Moreover,PeptostreptococcusandGemellaincreased whileCampylobacterandAggregatibacterreduced, affecting several oral microbiome pathways, such as the reduction of glutathione and porphyrin metabolism or the enhancement of the biosynthesis of steroids and the metabolism of tryptophan [52]. Specifically, tryptophan degradation is associated with the pathogenesis of oral cancer as it activates the kynurenine pathway [53]. Within this pathway, IDO enzymatic activity plays a role in the rate-limiting step and its contribution has been tied to the promotion and invasion of cancerous cells while its increase is attributed to proinflammatory cytokines [53].3.3. CocaineCocaine stands as one of the most common psychoactive drugs that stimulates a feeling of euphoria after altering brain chemistry. Although it is often consumed intranasally, addicts have tendencies to rub the drug on the gingival surface of teeth as to test the purity of the substance [54]. Cocaine has a pH of 4.5, making it capable of erosion of tooth enamel, which is an ideal environment for caries to thrive [55]. A low pH is able to produce an acidic environment where bacteria can flourish as well as causing demineralization to remain while the saliva\u2019s defense mechanism is unable to function [39]. In a study conducted to reveal the status of the oral microbiome in cocaine users, saliva amongst these users showed significant enrichment in theStreptococcus\u2013related species as compared to non-users, which can be attributed to the loss of buffering ability of saliva [56]. Cocaine was shown to induce increased plasma levels of a variety of monocyte activation markers, including monocyte chemoattractant protein or macrophage inflammatory protein, that correlate to the presence ofStreptococcussince monocytes are often elevated in the presence of chronic inflammation [56]. Cytokines are also often produced by cells with inflamed tissues and cocaine users exhibit an increased activity of specific neutrophils that can produce cytokines such as IL-17, which is heavily associated with osteoclastic bone resorption that is stimulated by the expression ofRANKL42[57]. In addition, cytokines that are produced by T helper 1 and T helper 2 cells are disturbed while metalloproteinase-9 is heavily involved with tissue degradation [57]. Monocytes often appear in inflamed gums and respond by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, worsening inflammation and if left untreated, and can lead to the weaking of the body\u2019s ability to fight back [58]. Notably, the enhancement ofRANK-Lexpression from IL-17 is pronounced in gingiva of periodontitis patients and often promotes inflammation or bone destruction [58]. All factors that produce such imbalances potentially lead to dysbiosis and the overpowering of the body\u2019s natural defenses [57]. In relation to caries,Streptococcusgroups are the major contributors to erosion as they have the ability to adhere to enamel and produce extracellular polysaccharides along with the building up glycogen reserves, having a central role in the creation of an acidic environment [59]. The oral microbiome community is heavily disturbed with the increased usage of cocaine as the changing bacterial composition has a major impact on the regulation of caries.3.4. HeroinHeroin can be classified as a potent opioid that could be linked to several factors contributing to dental deterioration and vulnerability to caries. Common in heroin abusers, carious lesions tend to be rampant, appearing darker in color and covering labial or buccal surfaces in the oral cavity [60]. Heroin is able to mask dental pain as a result of the opioids\u2019 pain-relieving qualities, causing patients to prolong any dental visits until there is severe pain present, increasing the prevalence of dental disease [61]. Additionally, heroin has the ability to lower salivary production, leading to xerostomia and increases in the craving for sweets, which can also lead to increased caries [62]. Users with a history of heroin abuse have been seen to develop mandibular osteomyelitis, chronic damage in the bone, which can be caused byCandida albicans[63].Candidais often characterized as a trigger for infections, including periodontitis, where the species occupies the periodontal pocket, or in some instances, peri-implantitis\u2014an inflammation o soft and hard gum tissue around implant sites\u2014as it adheres to the implant surface [64,65].Neisseria subflavahave been found among decreased species in heroin users\u2019 oral cavities, which occur in lower abundances of caries-infested oral environments [33].Neisseriaspecies are considered nitrate-reducing bacteria that have a role in regulation pH of the oral cavity and maintain homeostasis to slow the progression of caries, however this mechanism needs further study [66].4. Dental Implications of Pharmaceutical DrugsOne of the most important factors that affect the microbial communities in the oral cavity is drug use. Both drug classes with intended and unintended antimicrobial actions impact the composition of the microbiome resulting in therapeutic activity or the development of diseases [67]. This imbalance of the oral microbiome is known as dysbiosis, which leads to interruption of the microecological balance between host and microorganisms, resulting in oral and systemic diseases. Generally, oral microorganisms maintain their balance through synergistic and antagonistic interactions among each other, keeping the detrimental microbes, such asVeillonella,Scardovia,Lactobacillus, andPropionibacterium, at low levels [68,69]. Antibiotics such as amoxicillin (AMX), metronidazole (MTZ), and spiramycin (SP) cause dysbiosis as they contribute to the reduction of microbial diversity and trigger metabolic changes. A study found that over six months, amoxicillin decreased the diversity and population of Actinobacteria and increased the population of Proteobacteria, which are antibiotic resistant strains. Imbalance caused by antibiotics leads to the outgrowth of resistant strains which negatively affects the overall health [70,71]. Another study revealed that Candida growth can be effectively controlled using antifungal medications, resulting in an immediate decrease in the symptoms of oral thrush. However, antifungals can also lead to dysbiosis through a reduction in fungal populations, which indirectly influence bacterial communities [72]. In addition, medications, such as thyroid hormones, statins, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), significantly influenced the oral microbiome. They either enriched or depleted populations ofSaprospiraceae(uncultured),Bacillus,Johnsonella,Actinobacillus,Stenotrophomonas, andMycoplasma[73].Dental caries are a cavity in the form of a small lesion on the tooth surface that may lead to loss of tooth structure [74]. This disease emerges from the biofilm on the surface of the teeth, which is composed of polymicrobial communities formed by the oral microbiota [75,76]. Extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) are the main component of the caries biofilm that promotes the growth of cariogenic microorganisms by providing a pathological environment. Cariogenic microorganisms include the acid-producing bacteria, such asVeillonella,Scardovia,Lactobacillus, andPropionibacterium, that contribute to the progression of dental caries [77,78,79]. The development of dental caries is even worse when the dietary carbohydrates are fermented by the bacteria accumulated in the dental plaque for an extended period. The fermentation process leads to demineralization of the teeth if the produced acids cannot be neutralized by the buffering capacity of the salvia resulting in the formation of cavities [80].Pharmaceutical drugs have the ability to influence dental caries through altering the oral environment, salivary flow, the composition\u2019s pH levels, and the oral microbiota balance [81]. Saliva consists of water, calcium, and phosphate, which decreases the solubility of hydroxyapatite, the main component of teeth. Depending on the different types of buffering systems in the saliva, such as bicarbonate, phosphate, urea, and amino peptides, the saliva maintains a neutral oral cavity pH value up to 7.67 [82]. Reducing the solubility of hydroxyapatite leads to inhibition of tooth demineralization [83]. In addition, they further decrease the protective effects of the saliva by altering its composition and lowering the salivary pH. As a result, the susceptibility to oral pathologies rise due to the increased populations ofS. mutansandLactobacillus acidophilus[81,84]. A main cause of xerostomia is polypharmacy, which is the use of five or more medications and affects around 20% of patients in the United States [85]. According to previous clinical studies, the risk of developing caries increases with decreased salivary flow. In spite of maintaining good oral hygiene, patients with xerostomia experience rapid onset and progression of carious lesions [86]. Drug-induced xerostomia occurs when medications inhibit the function of muscarinic receptors in the salivary glands, leading to a reduction in the flow of saliva.Anticholinergic medications are known for significantly impairing the secretion of saliva and decreasing its protective functions, increasing the risk of dental caries [87]. More than 600 medications have anticholinergic properties that compromise the function of salivary glands. Antihistamines, antispasmodics, antidepressants, and antipsychotics are the most widely prescribed medications with anticholinergic side effects [85]. In addition, the use of inhaled corticosteroids, such as beta2-agonits for asthma treatment, reduce salivary flow and pH, which leads to a proliferation of harmfulLactobacilliandStreptococcus mutansin the mouth. Therefore, these medications raise the likelihood of oral problems, such as dental caries, dental erosion, tooth loss, periodontal disease, and oral candidiasis. Moreover, some dry powdered asthma medications consist of lactose monohydrate which is a fermentable sugar. These sugars play a significant role in increasing the risk of developing dental caries as they alter the composition of saliva [82]. Antibiotics can indirectly increase the risk of dental caries by causing an imbalance in the oral microbiome and proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria [88]. Despite this, antibiotics have been prescribed to treat bacterial infections and to prevent or treat dental caries. Over the recent years, the use of antibiotics gradually dropped due to the emergence of other antimicrobial agents that target oral bacteria responsible for oral disorders. Antimicrobial agents include fluoride, chlorhexidine, quaternary ammonium salts, and antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) [89]. Fluoride is among the most effective cavity prevention agents as it increases the remineralization of the tooth through the contact of fluoride ions with the minerals on the tooth surface. This prevents the acid-induced demineralization by cariogenic bacteria. Additionally, fluoride\u2019s ability to inhibit the enzyme enolase in the glycolytic pathway, results in suppression of the growth and acid production of oral streptococci, includingS. mutans[90].5. ConclusionsSubstance use and abuse continues to be a growing problem worldwide, with many people underestimating the impact on oral health and instead focusing on consequences, such as liver disease or cardiovascular consequences [91,92,93,94]. Through our review, it became evident that a significant factor in the impact of substance use on oral health and consequently whole body health is that the oral cavity is comprised of a highly interconnected network of microorganisms susceptible to imbalance and destruction [95]. Of greatest concern is the significant link between oral dysbiosis and carcinogenesis [96]. Higher alcohol consumption has been linked to the enrichment of periodontopathogenic bacteria that produce acetaldehyde, while simultaneously decreasing the abundance of bacteria or anti-oxidants that would reduce this carcinogenic byproduct [17,23]. Acetaldehyde dehydrogenase activity is known to be reduced in the oral cavity, which further increases the harmful effects of this destructive byproduct [97]. The bacterial dysbiosis due to alcohol also leads to an increase in bacteria-releasing inflammatory cytokines and severe consequences on the immune system [24]. Interestingly, a similar pattern of increased inflammatory cytokines from oral microbiome shifts is also observed with methamphetamine and cocaine use as well [49,56]. Pharmaceutical use also appears to follow the same pattern of disrupting normal oral flora, leading to a decrease in beneficial microbes with a simultaneous increase in detrimental periodontopathogenic microbes [70,71,72].Fusobacterium nucleatumandPorphyromonas gingivalisare two oral microbiome members highly associated with tumorigenesis development and progression through mechanisms of pro-inflammatory cytokines, immune suppression, and apoptosis inhibition [96]. Even though fusobacterium was previously associated with colorectal carcinoma, it has now been seen as an enriched periodontal pathogen associated with oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma [98]. Fusobacterium enrichment in tumor samples has been shown to be associated with increased programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) mRNA expression and increased surface PD-L1 protein expression [98]. These oral microbiotas are also able to reduce the efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents, in addition to causing cancer complications. For example,F. nucleatuminhibits TLR4 and MyD88 immune mechanisms and activates autophagy, while also increasing chemokine production and inhibiting T cell function [96].P. gingivalishas also been shown to reduce the efficacy of chemotherapeutics, including an increased resistance to Taxol and Paclitaxel via Notch1 activation [96]. Even commensal fungi of the oral mycobiome can become problematic instigators of carcinogenesis as opportunistic pathogens [97].C. albicans, for instance, can generate carcinogenic products, such as nitrosamines or N-nitrosobenzylmethylamine, that can bind DNA and trigger cancerous progressions [97]. The great impact of oral microbiota dysbiosis in cancer development and progression is also made clear by the finding that localized infections of the upper respiratory tract negatively impact the outcome of oral cancer [99].It has further been shown that the use of these substances in combination, such as someone partaking in alcohol use or medications and smoking, causes the effects to be even more deleterious as a synergistic impact appears [18,20,25]. It should be noted though, that it is difficult to obtain pure data on the true extent of individual alcohol and drug abuse towards dental complications, since there also exist many confounding factors as many of these patients tend to have simultaneous vices or poor hygiene habits, as well as poorer access to health care with varying social statuses.Through this review it has become evident that recreational substances, including alcohol use, as well as pharmaceutical drug use can lead to significant consequences disrupting the oral microbiome and thus consequently impacting human health. This is of great significance clinically and in the research world, as these impacts on oral health in turn lead to a poor quality of life and can disrupt daily life functioning. Furthermore, exploring the impact of these substances on the oral microbiome and health can help in the development of personalized medicine, creation of safer alternatives of legal substances or pharmaceuticals, an increase in funding towards preventative programs or rehabilitations, and an overall increase in societal awareness initiatives for better public health and regulations. Specific microbial pathways or mechanisms can be targeted for therapeutic developments, such as theFusobacteriumorCandidamechanisms described in this review [96,98]. It also helps demonstrate the need to collect more extensive medical histories and lists of substance intake when treating or evaluating patients in dental practices, as ceasing problematic behaviors can prevent further visits to the dentist after the current damage is treated. Healthcare and addiction aid specialists should be made aware of these significant consequences and cascades in oral health. Additionally, studies demonstrate that substance use participants have lower oral microbiome diversity and an increase in negative periodontopathic strains. It is believed that the oral microbiome may be able to be used as a \u201crisk or severity biological marker,\u201d which can further enhance healthcare targeting of patients [100]. While dysbiosis and cancer emerge as major themes of consequences to oral disruption from substance use, it brings to light the question of how many other ailments may be linked to oral health that we have not yet found connections for. This will also hopefully encourage further study into the many other products that people use daily that may activate similar mechanisms and dysbiosis, furthering the increases in oral cancers and related consequences.Author ContributionsAll authors (M.M.E., J.K. and M.M.) contributed equally to all writing, editing, reviewing, and figure development.
